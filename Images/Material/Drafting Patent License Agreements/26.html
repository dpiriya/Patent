<div class="ddw18">Chapter 26: Confidential Disclosure Agreements</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 26.00A&mdash;Definition of Confidential Information 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; as used in this Agreement means all technical or business information disclosed by ABC Company to XYZ Company pursuant to this Agreement that is identified at the time of disclosure or within thirty (30) days thereafter as being confidential and proprietary to ABC Company.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 26.00B&mdash;Definition of Confidential Information 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; means information or material, in tangible, electronic, verbal, graphic, visual, or other form, that either is marked as confidential or, due to its character and the circumstances of disclosure, a reasonable person would understand is confidential, that one Party discloses or demonstrates to another Party.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 26.00C&mdash;Exclusions from Confidential Information</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">No information will be regarded as Confidential Information if XYZ Company can show by competent proof that such information:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. was, at the time of disclosure to XYZ Company, already known by XYZ Company, as shown by written records in the possession of XYZ Company;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. was at the time of disclosure, or subsequently became, through no fault of XYZ Company, known to the general public through publication or otherwise; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. was, subsequent to disclosure to XYZ Company, lawfully and independently received by XYZ Company from a third party who had the right to disclose it without restriction.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 26.00D&mdash;Exclusions from Confidential Information (Addition)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any combination of Confidential Information will not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company merely because individual elements thereof are in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 26.01A&mdash;Scope of Disclosure</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">ABC Company, at its discretion, may disclose to XYZ Company any Confidential Information that ABC Company, in its reasonable judgment, believes is sufficient to enable XYZ Company to design, manufacture, or sell the ABC Widgets.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 26.01B&mdash;Warranty of Disclosure</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">ABC Company warrants that the Confidential Information disclosed to XYZ Company (a) fairly represents the entire body of Confidential Information in the possession of ABC Company that relates to the subject matter of this Agreement, (b) is all the information in the possession of ABC Company that is material to the subject matter of this Agreement, and (c) is not inconsistent in substance, quality, or quantity with other information in the possession of ABC Company that is material to the subject matter of this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01C"></a>Form 26.01C&mdash;Approval of Disclosure</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each party, before disclosing any information to the other party, will provide the other party a non-confidential summary thereof and will disclose to the other party only the information that it agrees to receive within 30 days after receipt of the summary.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 26.02A&mdash;Confidentiality Obligations</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In consideration of each and every disclosure of Confidential Information by ABC Company to XYZ Company, XYZ Company agrees</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. to treat as confidential and to preserve the confidentiality of all Confidential Information disclosed by ABC Company to XYZ Company;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. to use any and all Confidential Information solely for evaluating whether to accept a license for the Confidential Information;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. to make no disclosures of any Confidential Information to anyone other than officers and employees of XYZ Company; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">d. to limit access to Confidential Information to those officers and employees of XYZ Company who have a reasonable need for access to the Confidential Information and are bound by a written obligation to XYZ Company to maintain such Confidential Information as confidential.</p>
<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 26.02B&mdash;Limit on Use</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">XYZ Company may use Confidential Information solely for evaluation of its commercial potential and may not use it in conjunction with any other research activity or commercial endeavor. XYZ Company may not combine or commingle Confidential Information with any other information in XYZ Company&rsquo;s possession.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03"></a>Form 26.03&mdash;Residual Rights</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Receiving Party has the right to retain, use and disclose, without accounting to the Disclosing Party, any Confidential Information that is Residual Knowledge. &ldquo;Residual Knowledge&rdquo; means and includes only non-recorded information of the type that applicable law would permit an employee of the Receiving Party to retain and use in subsequent employment with a third party. This exception to the obligations of confidentiality and non-use is to be narrowly construed, is intended only to alleviate the possibility of inadvertent breach of this Agreement arising from routine, unaided memory retention by employees of the Receiving Party, and is not intended to permit the Receiving Party to intentionally use or disclose information known to the Receiving Party to be Confidential Information subject to this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="05A"></a>Form 26.05A&mdash;License Option</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In conjunction with evaluation of the Confidential Information under this Agreement, ABC hereby grants XYZ a nonexclusive option for a license under the Confidential Information and associated intellectual property rights. XYZ may exercise the option by written notice received by ABC not later than midnight on the 30th day after the Effective Date or the date ABC notifies XYZ that all Confidential Information has been disclosed to it, whichever is later. Upon proper exercise of the option by XYZ, ABC agrees to negotiate with XYZ in good faith the terms and conditions of such a license. If XYZ fails to exercise the option by the date specified or the parties fail to reach an agreement on the terms and conditions of such a license within 90 days after exercise of the option, ABC will have no further obligation to negotiate or grant such a license to XYZ.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="05B"></a>Form 26.05B&mdash;Terms of the License Option</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The license agreement to be negotiated in good faith will include at least the following provisions:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. The license will be exclusive for North America and nonexclusive everywhere else.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. The royalty payable for the license will be in the range of 3&ndash;6% of the Net Sales Price of products incorporating or made using any Confidential Information.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. The term of the license will be for a minimum of ten (10) years.</p>
