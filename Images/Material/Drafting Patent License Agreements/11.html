<div class="ddw18">Chapter 11: Reservations and Improvements</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 11.00A&mdash;Examples of a Reservation of Rights in Grantor</p>
<p class="h4"><a name="00A1"></a>Form 11.00A1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The license granted in Article ____ of this Agreement is subject to a reserved nonexclusive license in the Licensor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Licensed Products.</p>
<p class="h4"><a name="00A2"></a>Form 11.00A2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The license granted in Article ____ of this Agreement is subject to a reserved nonexclusive license in the Licensor to make Licensed Products and to use, sell, offer for sale, and import such Licensed Products as components incorporated in communication equipment of its manufacture, but not otherwise.</p>
<p class="h4"><a name="00A3"></a>Form 11.00A3</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The license granted in Article ____ of this Agreement is subject to a reserved nonexclusive license in the Licensor to use the Licensed Process in its manufacturing facilities for the production of communication equipment, but not otherwise.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 11.00B&mdash;Reservation (Prior Licenses) 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser (or Licensee), his successors, and assigns take the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. ____ (or the aforesaid license) subject to any outstanding licenses, options to acquire licenses, or other rights existing in third parties under agreements executed by ABC Company prior to the effective date of this agreement.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 11.00C&mdash;Reservation (Prior Licenses) 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Notwithstanding the exclusive character of certain licenses granted in this Agreement, Licensee takes such licenses subject to any rights in third parties established by agreements entered into by ABC prior to the date of the Agreement. In this connection ABC represents that no rights have been granted to others in specific reference to the patents that are the subject matter of this Agreement and that no licenses have been granted affecting the subject matter of such patents that would in its judgment significantly diminish the value of the rights herein conveyed. These patents are, however, subject to certain comprehensively defined nonexclusive rights that have been granted by ABC in reference to particular fields of use, e.g., under all ABC patents insofar as these apply to inventions useful in public service communication.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 11.00D&mdash;Reservation (Future Licenses)</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. While ABC recognizes that its grant of exclusive rights to Licensee in the present Agreement involves a commitment on its part not to grant other licenses in derogation of these rights, Licensee on its part recognizes the extraordinary diversity of ABC&rsquo;s business activities and patent licensing arrangements and agrees that inadvertent inclusion by ABC of limited rights in the patents exclusively licensed hereunder in any future grant by ABC to others of general or field licenses shall not be deemed to be in derogation of Licensee&rsquo;s rights or a breach of this Agreement provided such limited rights:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) Do not impinge directly on the field of this Agreement; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) Do not tend in any substantial way to diminish the value of the rights extended to Licensee under the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 above, if future rights granted by ABC to others than Licensee are considered by Licensee to diminish in any substantial way the value of the rights extended to Licensee under the terms of this Agreement, ABC agrees to negotiate in good faith with Licensee respecting the substantiality of such diminution and the appropriateness of reducing the compensation paid to ABC under this Agreement in order to reflect the magnitude of the diminution.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. In event of the failure of the parties to agree in respect to the matters referred to in paragraph 1 above, the issues in dispute will be submitted to arbitration, either under the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association or as otherwise may be mutually determined by the parties at the time.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00E"></a>Form 11.00E&mdash;Reservation (Prior Licenses) 3</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor has noted and Licensee recognizes and accepts the possible existence, in reference to particular patents or situations, of prior commitments of the Licensor that may be inconsistent in some respect with the commitments of this Agreement, but Licensor represents and warrants that it has accepted no commitments or restrictions that will materially affect the value of the licenses and rights granted by it in this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 11.01A&mdash;Improvement Definition</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Improvement,&rdquo; as used in this Agreement, means any modification of a device described in a Licensed Patent, provided such modification, if unlicensed, would infringe one or more claims of the Licensed Patents.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 11.01B&mdash;Improvement Definition (Process)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Improvement,&rdquo; as used in this agreement, means any modification of a process described in a Licensed Patent, provided such modification, if unlicensed, would infringe one or more claims of the Licensed Patents.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01C"></a>Form 11.01C&mdash;Improvement Exclusion</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Improvement&rdquo; does not mean or include developments in respect to components, materials, or processes that are useful in practicing the inventions of the Licensed Patents, but that do not themselves infringe the claims of the Licensed Patents.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01D"></a>Form 11.01D&mdash;Improvements Definition (Broad)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Improvement&rdquo; means (a) any new or modified product that performs the same function as the Licensed Product in a better or more economical way, or (b) any new or modified product that performs the same function as the Licensed Product and costs less to manufacture than the Licensed Product.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01E"></a>Form 11.01E&mdash;Improvement Grant Clause</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor further agrees to grant to Licensee licenses of the scope specified in paragraph 1 of this Article ____ in respect to patents on any Improvements (as defined in paragraph __, above) that are first conceived and actually or constructively reduced to practice prior to the second anniversary of the effective date of this Agreement and as to which, prior to that anniversary, Licensor has the right to grant such licenses without payment to other than employees of Licensor.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01F"></a>Form 11.01F&mdash;Grantback License</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee hereby agrees to grant to Licensor a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license under any Improvement (as defined in paragraph __,  above), and any patent disclosing such Improvement, that is first conceived and actually or constructively reduced to practice prior to the second anniversary of the effective date of this Agreement and as to which, prior to that anniversary, Licensee has the right to grant such licenses without payment to others than employees of Licensee. Licensee will disclose any such Improvement to Licensor in writing within sixty (60) days after its actual or constructive reduction to practice.</p>
