<p class="ddw12">2.02 &ldquo;Improvement&rdquo; or &ldquo;Improvements&rdquo; means any patented modification of a device, method, or product described in a Patent, provided such a modification, if unlicensed, would infringe one or more claims of issued Patents.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3262-5" id="footnote-3262-5-backlink" name="footnote-3262-5-backlink">[5]</a></p>

Where products are not sold, but are otherwise disposed of, the Net Sales Price of such products for the purposes of computing royalties will be the selling price at which products of similar kind and quality, sold in similar quantities, are currently being offered for sale by Licensee. Where such products are not currently being offered for sale by Licensee, the Net Sales Price of products otherwise disposed of, for the purpose of computing royalties, will be the average selling price at which products of similar kind and quality, sold in similar quantities, are then currently being offered for sale by other manufacturers. Where such products are not currently sold or offered for sale by Licensee or others, then the Net Sales Price, for the purposes of computing royalties, will be Licensee&rsquo;s cost of manufacture, determined by Licensee&rsquo;s customary accounting procedures, plus __________ percent (_______%). In order to assure to Licensor the full royalty payments contemplated in this Agreement, Licensee agrees that in the event any Licensed Products are sold for purposes of resale either (1) to a corporation, firm, or association that, or individual who, owns a controlling interest in Licensee by stock ownership or otherwise, or (2) to a corporation, firm, or association in which Licensee or its stockholders own a controlling interest by stock ownership or otherwise, the royalties to be paid in respect to such Licensed Products will be computed on the Net Selling Price at which the purchaser for resale sells such Products rather than upon the Net Selling Price of the Licensee.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3262-8" id="footnote-3262-8-backlink" name="footnote-3262-8-backlink">[8]</a></p>

<p class="ddw12">5.02 Licensor may, by written notice to Licensee, terminate this Agreement during any February subsequent to the year 20__, if Licensee has not practiced the Patents during the calendar year that precedes each such February to the extent of generating earned royalties as provided by Section 4.01 of this Agreement in the amount of _____________ ($________).</p>

<p class="ddw12">6.00 During the Exclusive Term, Licensee will use commercially reasonable efforts to promote, negotiate and grant sublicenses in the Licensed Field and Licensed Territory, and it is the intent of the parties that sublicenses will be available to all qualified third parties on fair and reasonable terms. Sublicenses will be nonexclusive, not transferable by the sublicensee, and by the Licensee only to Licensor. Licensee will supply Licensor with a copy of each such sublicense agreement within thirty (30) days after the execution of the sublicense agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.01 The royalty for sublicensees will be no less than that set forth for Licensee in Section 4.01, above.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.02 Licensee will pay to Licensor _________________ percent (__________%) of any and all income received by Licensee from sublicensing. Payment of Licensor&rsquo;s share of sublicensing income will be made to Licensor semiannually as provided in Section 7.00.</p>

In the event that the amounts due at the end of any calendar year do not equal the minimum royalties specified in Section 5.00 for said calendar year, Licensee must pay to Licensor, on or before the last day of the following January, the amount required to satisfy the minimum royalty obligation for the preceding calendar year. Such amounts are due at the dates the statements are due. If no amount is accrued during any semiannual period, a written statement to that effect will be furnished.</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.01 Payments provided for in this Agreement, when overdue, will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of the maximum permitted by law or five percent (5%) in excess of the &ldquo;Prime Rate&rdquo; published by &ldquo;The Wall Street Journal&rdquo; at the time such payment is due, and for the time period until payment is received by Licensor.</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.02 If this Agreement is for any reason terminated before all of the payments herein provided for have been made (including minimum royalties for the year in which the Agreement is terminated), Licensee must immediately submit a terminal report and pay to Licensor any remaining unpaid balance even though the due date as above provided has not been reached.</p>

<p class="ddw12">9.00 This Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the Patents and Improvements included herein, or upon the abandonment of the last to be abandoned of any Patents included herein, whichever is later, unless the Agreement is sooner terminated.</p>
<p class="ddw12">9.01 Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time upon sixty (60) days&rsquo; written notice in advance to Licensor.</p>
<p class="ddw12">9.02 If either party is in default of any obligation hereunder, or is adjudged bankrupt, or becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or is placed in the hands of a receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy, the other party may terminate this Agreement by giving sixty (60) days&rsquo; notice by Registered Mail to the other party, specifying the basis for termination. If within sixty (60) days after the receipt of such notice, the party receiving notice remedies the condition forming the basis for termination, such notice will cease to be operative, and this Agreement will continue in full force.</p>
<p class="ddw12">9.03 The word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; and cognate words, such as &ldquo;term&rdquo; and &ldquo;terminate,&rdquo; used in this Article IX and elsewhere in this Agreement are to be read, except where the contrary is specifically indicated, as omitting from their effect the following rights and obligations, all of which will survive any termination to the degree necessary to permit their complete fulfillment or discharge:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Licensee&rsquo;s obligation to supply a terminal report as specified in Section 7.02 of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Licensor&rsquo;s right to receive or recover and Licensee&rsquo;s obligation to pay royalties (including minimum royalties) accrued or accruable for payment at the time of any termination.</p>

<p class="ddw12">10.01 Licensee has the first right to institute suit for infringement(s) in the Licensed Field and the Licensed Territory so long as this Agreement remains exclusive. Licensor agrees to join as a party plaintiff in any such lawsuit initiated by Licensee, if requested by Licensee, with all costs, attorneys&rsquo; fees, and expenses to be paid by Licensee. However, if Licensee does not institute suit for infringement(s) within ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from Licensor of Licensor&rsquo;s desire to bring suit for infringement in its own name and on its own behalf, then Licensor may, at its own expense, bring suit or take any other appropriate action.</p>
<p class="ddw12">10.02 If this Agreement is nonexclusive at the time of infringement(s), Licensor will have the sole right to institute suit for infringement and to recover damages.</p>
<p class="ddw12">10.03 Licensee will be entitled to any recovery of damages resulting from a lawsuit brought by it pursuant to Section 10.01.

<p class="ddw12">10.04 Neither party may settle with an infringer without the prior approval of the other party if such settlement would affect the rights of the other party under the Patents and Improvements.</p>
<p class="h3">XI. Records</p>

<p class="h3">XII. Nonassignability<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3262-19" id="footnote-3262-19-backlink" name="footnote-3262-19-backlink">[19]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">12.00 The parties agree this Agreement imposes personal obligations on Licensee. Licensee may not assign any rights under this Agreement not specifically transferable by its terms without the written consent of Licensor. Licensor may assign its rights hereunder.</p>
<p class="h3">XIII. Severability</p>
<p class="ddw12">13.00 The parties agree that if any part, term, or provision of this Agreement is found illegal or in conflict with any valid controlling law, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected thereby.</p>
<p class="ddw12">13.01 In the event the legality of any provision of this Agreement is brought into question because of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, Licensor, by written notice to Licensee, may revise the provision in question or may delete it entirely so as to comply with the decision of said court.</p>

<p class="ddw12">14.00 In publicizing anything made, used, offered for sale, sold, or imported under this Agreement, Licensee may not use the name of Licensor or otherwise refer to any organization related to Licensor, except with the written approval of Licensor.</p>
<p class="h3">XV. Waiver, Integration, Alteration</p>
<p class="ddw12">15.00 The waiver of a breach hereunder may be effected only by a writing signed by the waiving party and will not constitute a waiver of any other breach.</p>
<p class="ddw12">15.01 This Agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties, and supersedes all other agreements, express or implied, between the parties concerning Patents and Improvements.</p>
<p class="ddw12">15.02 A provision of this Agreement may be altered only by a writing signed by both parties, except as provided in Sections 13.00 and 13.01, above.</p>
