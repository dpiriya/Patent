<p class="ddw12noindent">All payments specified by this agreement must be made in the City of New York, State of New York, in U.S. currency. Such U.S. currency payments must be determined on the basis of the official rate of exchange as determined by the _________ Bank, or equivalent governmental agency of _________, in effect on the last business day of the period for which such payments are being paid. All payments due must be made without deduction for taxes, assessments, or other charges of any kind that may be imposed on Licensor by any government other than that of the United States, or any political subdivision of such other government, with respect to any amounts payable to Licensor pursuant to this Agreement, and such taxes, assessments, or other charges must be assumed by Licensee.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 29.00B&mdash;Place of Payment, Rate of Exchange, Tax Burden Allocated</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Payments will be due on the last day of each calendar quarter and must be paid within ninety (90) days thereafter by Licensee to Licensor in New York, New York, United States of America, in U.S. currency without deduction for taxes, assessments, or other charges of any kind or description, except that income taxes required to be withheld by the Government of _________ on amounts payable to Licensor hereunder may be deducted to the extent that such taxes are allowable as a direct credit to Licensor against U.S. income taxes levied on such amounts, provided that Licensee pays the taxes on behalf of Licensor and provides Licensor with a receipt therefor. The U.S. currency amounts payable hereunder shall be determined on the basis of the New York selling rate of exchange as reported in the &ldquo;Wall Street Journal&rdquo; as applicable to each such payment on the payment date thereof, or ninety (90) days after the due date, whichever is earlier.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 29.00C&mdash;Tax Burden Allocated</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">All payments and fees required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (a) are exclusive of all sales tax, use tax, value-added tax, tariffs, duties or other similar tax (which sales tax, use tax, value-added tax, tariffs, duties or other similar tax or governmental charge will be borne and paid by the payor Party) and (b) will be paid with deduction therefrom solely for income tax, or withholding tax in lieu of income tax, applicable to a payee Party that is required pursuant to applicable law to be deducted therefrom. If a payee Party claims an exemption from, or reduction of, income tax, or withholding tax in lieu of income tax, under the law of the jurisdiction in which the payor Party is located, or under any treaty to which the payee Party is subject, with respect to payments owed pursuant to this Agreement, the payee Party will deliver to the payor Party any such forms or other certifications as may be required under the laws of such jurisdiction as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, such withholding tax or income tax. The payor Party agrees to review such forms or certifications and to withhold or deduct at such reduced rate, provided that the requirements for such exemption from, or reduction in the amount of, such withholding tax or income tax, have been satisfied, as determined in the reasonable discretion of the payor Party. The payor Party will provide the payee Party with a certificate or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the payee Party evidencing payment of any such withholding taxes to the applicable governmental or other taxing authority.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 29.01B&mdash;Government Approval Required for Agreement to Become Effective (Alternative 2)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The effective date of this Agreement will be the date when the Agreement, including its payment provisions, is finally validated by the _________ Government or its appropriate agency, or when an export license is issued by the U.S. Government or its appropriate agency, with respect to the export of Manufacturing Data, whichever date is later. Licensee will use its best efforts to obtain validation by the _________ Government, and Licensor will use its best efforts to obtain an export license from the U.S. Government, but if both the validation and license have not been obtained by _________, 20 ___, this Agreement will on that date become void and of no effect.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 29.02A&mdash;Licensee Required to Register Agreement</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If the terms of this Agreement are such as to require or make it appropriate that the Agreement or any part of it be registered with or reported to a national or supranational agency having authority over a territory in which Licensee will do business under the Agreement, Licensee, within _________ days of the effective date of the Agreement, and at Licensee&rsquo;s expense, will undertake such registration or report. Prompt notice and appropriate verification of the act of registration or report of any agency ruling resulting from it will be supplied by Licensee to Licensor.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 29.02B&mdash;Alternate Licensee Recording Requirement</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any formal recordation of this Agreement required by the law of ________________ as a prerequisite to enforceability of the Agreement in the courts of ________________ or for other reasons will also be carried out by Licensee at its expense, and appropriately verified proof of recordation will be promptly furnished to Licensor.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03A"></a>Form 29.03A&mdash;Agreement Terminable Due to Government Action</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Either party may, immediately upon notice, terminate this Agreement in its entirety or with respect to any patent license granted under the Agreement if:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. Such termination is necessary to comply with an order or official request of the government of the terminating party, or</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="03B"></a>Form 29.03B&mdash;Agreement Terminable by Licensor</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor may, immediately upon notice, terminate this Agreement in its entirety or with respect to any license or right granted by it under this Agreement if, by law or regulation of the Government of ________________, Licensee is disabled from making the payments to Licensor that it is required to make under the Agreement, and such disability continues for more than ninety (90) days.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="04"></a>Form 29.04&mdash;Choice of Applicable Law</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">This Agreement and the relationships between the parties shall be governed in all respects by the law of ________________, except that questions affecting the construction and effect of any patent shall be determined by the law of the country in which the patent has been granted.</p>

<p class="ddw12noindent">This instrument of Agreement has been executed by the parties in counterpart originals, one in the English language and one in the French language. Either the English or the French version may be offered in evidence by either party without objection by the other party as comprising the true and complete agreement of the parties. In the event of any discrepancy between the two versions, the English version will control.</p>
