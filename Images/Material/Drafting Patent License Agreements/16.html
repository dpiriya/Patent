<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 16.00A&mdash;Warranty of Right to Grant License</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor represents and warrants in respect to the Licensed Patents that it has and will continue to have<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1932-1" id="footnote-1932-1-backlink" name="footnote-1932-1-backlink">[1]</a> the legal power to extend the rights granted to Licensee in this Agreement and that it has not made and will not make any commitments to others inconsistent with or in derogation of such rights.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 16.00B&mdash;Licensor Warrants It Will Use Due Care to Secure Ownership of Future Inventions by Its Employees</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor will throughout the term of this Agreement, as far as it is reasonably practicable for it to do so, cause its employees who are employed to do research, development, or other inventive work to disclose to it inventions within the scope of this Agreement and to assign to it rights in such inventions such that Licensee receives, by virtue of this Agreement, the licenses agreed to be granted to it, it being understood that if due care and diligence are used, any inadvertent failure to comply with this section of the Agreement will not constitute a breach of the Agreement.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 16.00C&mdash;Licensor Obligates Itself to Secure Ownership of Future Inventions by Its Employees</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor warrants that it will acquire from its employees who are employed to do research, development, or other inventive work, and from corresponding employees of its subsidiaries, rights to inventions made during the term of this Agreement that relate to the subject matter of licenses agreed to be granted to Licensee, such that Licensee will, by virtue of this Agreement, receive from Licensor, without payments beyond those provided in Article ___, the licenses so agreed to be granted.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 16.00D&mdash;Qualification of Licensor&rsquo;s Obligation to Secure Rights to Grant Licenses on Future Inventions</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">It is recognized that Licensor may have contracted or may hereafter contract, directly or indirectly, with governmental agencies or other entities to do development work financed by such agencies or entities on terms that require Licensor to assign to the agencies or entities title to inventions arising out of such work or that otherwise restrain Licensor from granting licenses to others under such inventions. Inability of Licensor in respect to such inventions to grant the licenses purportedly agreed to be granted in this Agreement will not be considered a breach of the Agreement.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00E"></a>Form 16.00E&mdash;Elimination of Patent Rights Acquired by Payment From Scope of License Grant</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If Licensor acquires from someone other than employees of Licensor patents or licensing rights in patents on terms that require monetary payment by Licensor, such patents will not be subject to this Agreement except as the parties may subsequent to the date of the Agreement expressly agree.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00F"></a>Form 16.00F&mdash;Licensee Has Option to Obtain License Under After-Acquired Patents</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If Licensor, subsequent to the date of this Agreement, acquires from someone other than employees of Licensor patents or licensing rights in patents on terms that require payment of monetary or other consideration by Licensor, such patents will become subject to this Agreement only if Licensee agrees to pay Licensor a proportionately reasonable share of such monetary or other consideration.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00G"></a>Form 16.00G&mdash;Patent-Related Assurances to the Buyer of a Business</p>
				<ol class="ddw12noindent">
					<li>Schedule ___ sets forth a list of all Patents, Marks, registered Copyrights, proprietary Software, and Contracts conveying Intellectual Property rights that are Assigned Intellectual Property.</li>
					<li>Except as set forth on Schedule ___, Seller (i) exclusively owns the entire right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Intellectual Property, free and clear of Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances and Encumbrances that will be released at or prior to the Closing; (ii) with respect to Intellectual Property not being assigned (&ldquo;Retained Intellectual Property&rdquo;), owns or Controls sufficient right, title and interest in and to the Retained Intellectual Property to license such Intellectual Property to the Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Buyer License Agreement; and (iii) with respect to the Assigned Intellectual Property which Seller jointly owns with another Person, Seller has the right and license to use (including to license for use) the same in the conduct of the Business, as applicable, and to transfer all of Seller&rsquo;s rights and licenses to the Buyer as of the Closing Date as contemplated herein. Except for nonexclusive licenses conveyed pursuant to Seller&rsquo;s standard terms for purchase or sale of goods and services and licenses listed on Schedule ___, Seller has not granted any license to any Person for use of the Assigned Intellectual Property or Transferred Intellectual Property.</li>
					<li>To the Knowledge of Seller, as of the Closing Date, (i) all unexpired, issued patents in Assigned Intellectual Property are in force; (ii) all patent applications in Assigned Intellectual Property are pending without challenge (other than office actions issued in the ordinary course before the United States Patent and Trademark Office or its foreign equivalents); (iii) all maintenance fees, annuities, and renewal fees currently due in connection with Assigned Intellectual Property have been or will be timely paid.</li>
					<li>To the Knowledge of Seller, except as set forth on Schedule ___, during the six (6) years prior to Closing, Seller has not received any written claim, and no litigation, arbitration or administrative proceeding (except routine patent office proceedings) is currently pending against Seller (i) that alleges use of Assigned Intellectual Property, or the conduct of the Business has infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise conflicted with the Intellectual Property of another Person or (ii) that challenges the ownership, validity, enforceability, patentability, or use of any Assigned Intellectual Property.</li>
					<li>To the Knowledge of the Seller, as of the Closing, there is no unauthorized use, unauthorized disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any of the Assigned Intellectual Property by any third party, including any employee or former employee of Seller, and there is no pending action initiated by Seller for infringement or misappropriation of any Assigned Intellectual Property.</li>
					<li>To the Knowledge of the Seller, Seller has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all commercially valuable confidential or non-public information included in the Assigned Intellectual Property.</li>
					<li>To the Knowledge of Seller, neither the execution and delivery or effectiveness of this Agreement nor the performance of the Seller&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement will cause the forfeiture or termination of, or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of, any Assigned Intellectual Property, or impair the right of Buyer to use, possess, sell or license any Assigned Intellectual Property or any portion thereof. To the Knowledge of Seller, after the Closing, all Assigned Intellectual Property will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by the Buyer without restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party.</li>

<p class="h3"><a name="00H"></a>Form 16.00H&mdash;Knowledge Definition</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Knowledge of the Seller&rdquo; means, as to the existence or absence of a fact, the actual knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of the following officers and employees of th=e Seller: __________________________.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00I"></a>Form 16.00I&mdash;Alternative IP Warranties to the Buyer of a Business</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Disclosure Schedule ___ sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all Intellectual Property Rights (other than third-party software generally commercially available on a &ldquo;shrink wrap&rdquo; license or similar basis) now used or proposed, anticipated or contemplated to be used in the business of Seller and each of its Affiliates.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">With respect to each item of Intellectual Property licensed Seller or any of its Affiliates by a Third Party, such license is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect and no party to such license (including Seller or any of its Affiliates) is in breach or violation of, and no event has occurred which with notice or lapse of time would constitute a breach or violation of, such license.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Seller or one of its Affiliates owns or has the right to use (without the obligation to make any payment to others or the obligation to grant rights to others in exchange) all Intellectual Property necessary to conduct its business as presently being conducted.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule ___, there is no limitation imposed by contract, court order or otherwise on the ability of Seller or any of its Affiliates to use the Intellectual Property in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule ___, no charges, complaints, actions, suits, proceedings, hearings, claims or demands have been instituted, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened that challenges the validity of or title to any Intellectual Property, or the right of Seller or its Affiliates to use any Intellectual Property as it is presently using or proposes to use the Intellectual Property, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there is no basis for any such challenge.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">To the Knowledge of Seller, the conduct of the business of Seller and its Affiliates as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted and use of the Intellectual Property in such business, do not infringe or conflict in any respect with (a) the trademark, copyright or patent rights of any Person or (b) any other trade secret, intellectual property or other rights of any Person.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Seller and each of its Affiliates has, as of the date hereof, and will have as of the Closing, satisfied all current requirements necessary to maintain all Intellectual Property.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">To the Knowledge of Seller, no Person is using any of the Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to Seller or any of its Affiliates, except (i) Seller and its Affiliates or (ii) any Person duly licensed by Seller to use the same under a contract identified in Disclosure Schedule ___.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Except as set forth in Disclosure Schedule ___, to the Knowledge of Seller, there are not any efforts or actions by others to interfere with, infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual Property. All licenses and other agreements pertaining to the Intellectual Property are in compliance with all applicable Laws in all jurisdictions in which Seller or any of its Affiliates conducts any business operations, including those pertaining to remittance of foreign exchange and taxation.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Except as disclosed in Disclosure Schedule ___, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not affect the validity, or result in any loss or modification to, or any revocation, termination, cancellation or withdrawal of, any of the Intellectual Property and will not require the consent or approval of any Person under, or in connection with, any of the Intellectual Property.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00J"></a>Form 16.00J&mdash;Warranty of Actual Exclusivity</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor represents that it has not granted to anyone any rights under the Licensed Patent that remain in effect as of the Effective Date.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01"></a>Form 16.01&mdash;Negation of Implications by Licensor</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">1. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. A warranty or representation by Licensor as to the validity or scope of any Licensed Patent; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. A warranty or representation that anything made, used, sold, or otherwise disposed of under any license granted in this Agreement is or will be free from infringement of patents of third parties; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. A requirement that Licensor will file any patent application, secure any patent, or maintain any patent in force; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">d. An obligation to bring or prosecute actions or suits against third parties for infringement (except to the extent and in the circumstances stated in Article ___); or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">e. An obligation to furnish any manufacturing or technical information; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">f. Conferring a right to use in advertising, publicity, or otherwise any trademark or trade name of Licensor;<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1932-2" id="footnote-1932-2-backlink" name="footnote-1932-2-backlink">[2]</a> or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">g. Precluding the export or sale for export from the United States of Licensed Products on which royalties have been paid as provided in Article ___ (subject, however, to the understanding that no rights are granted or implied in respect to such exported products under any patent of Licensor or any other person in any foreign country); or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">h. Granting by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any licenses or rights under patents of Licensor other than Licensed Patents, regardless of whether such other patents are dominant of or subordinate to any Licensed Patent.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1932-3" id="footnote-1932-3-backlink" name="footnote-1932-3-backlink">[3]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">2. LICENSOR makes no representations; extends no warranties of any kind, either express or implied; and assumes no responsibilities whatever with respect to use, sale, or other disposition by LICENSEE or its vendees or other transferees of products incorporating or made by use of (a) inventions licensed under this Agreement or (b) information, if any, furnished under the Agreement.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1932-1-backlink" id="footnote-1932-1" name="footnote-1932-1">1</a>] By warranting that it will &ldquo;continue to have&rdquo; the power to extend the rights granted, licensor may be precluded from assigning the licensed patents. Assignment of the patents would deprive the licensor of the &ldquo;power to extend the rights granted to Licensee.&rdquo; A breach of this warranty may not be material since the licensee would retain all license rights because the assignee would be bound by the preexisting license. If this were an exclusive license, however, possession by the licensor of title to the licensed patent may be material to the exclusive licensee&rsquo;s ability to enforce the license.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1932-2-backlink" id="footnote-1932-2" name="footnote-1932-2">2</a>] Making clear that the licensee has no right to use licensor&rsquo;s name or marks may aid in avoiding liability arising from actions by the licensee.
