<p class="h3"><a name="01"></a>Form 28.01&mdash;Diligence and Unilateral Control</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party will diligently pursue its obligations as specified in this Agreement, in the Research Plan, and in any Development and Commercialization Plan(s) approved by the Joint Management Committee. Each Party will be free to select the methods and materials<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-1" id="footnote-1931-1-backlink" name="footnote-1931-1-backlink">[1]</a> it uses in performing its obligations, provided that each Party performs its obligations (whether itself, or with or through a contractor) in accordance with high scientific, clinical, and professional standards, and in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, and any applicable current good laboratory practices. Each Party will exercise reasonable diligence to avoid infringement of any third party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights, and a good faith belief that activities otherwise required under this Agreement might infringe a third party&rsquo;s intellectual property rights will excuse performance under the force majeure provision, Section ___, provided the party holding such belief provides notice thereof to the other Party.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-2" id="footnote-1931-2-backlink" name="footnote-1931-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 28.02A&mdash;Milestone Payments</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Beta will make payments to Alpha as set forth below:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. $________ upon identification of an Active Agent against a designated Target. This milestone payment will be paid only once per Target regardless of the number of Active Agents identified for such Target.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. $________ upon the filing of the first Investigational New Drug Application (or its equivalent in a Major Market Country)<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-3" id="footnote-1931-3-backlink" name="footnote-1931-3-backlink">[3]</a> for each Active Agent.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. $________ upon the initiation of the first Phase 2 clinical trial (or its equivalent in a Major Market Country) for the first Active Agent against a particular Target.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">4. $________ upon the first filing of a New Drug Application (or its equivalent in a Major Market Country) for the first Active Agent against a particular Target.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">5. $________ upon the first approval of a New Drug Application (or its equivalent in a Major Market Country) for the first Active Agent against a particular Target.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 28.02B&mdash;Contributions to the Collaboration</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The Parties intend to share equally the risks, expenses, and profit of the Collaboration Program. The Parties agree that the sum of the following contributions constitutes an equal sharing by the Parties to the point of decision by the Joint Management Committee to proceed with development of the first Collaboration Product:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(a) ALPHA performing, at its expense, evaluation of each potential target in accordance with evaluation criteria set forth in the Research Plan.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(b) ALPHA nominating at least ten (10) Evaluated Targets in the first twenty-four (24) months of the Research Term.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(c) ALPHA granting BETA a license under the ALPHA Background Rights for research purposes only in accordance with Section ___ of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(d) BETA performing, at its expense, BETA Validation of each Evaluated Target and disclosing the results to the Joint Management Committee.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02C"></a>Form 28.02C&mdash;Expense and Revenue Balancing Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Within forty-five (45) days following the end of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement, each Party will prepare and furnish to the other Party a written statement, in reasonably specific detail, stated in United States dollars, of Revenues and Allowable Expenses incurred during the preceding calendar quarter, in a form substantially the same as the form set forth in Exhibit ___, attached hereto. The Parties will agree on a means to determine an exchange rate for calculations that each Party will use when preparing these statements. Within thirty (30) days following receipt of each such statement, the Party with the higher Revenue will pay to the Party with the lower Revenue one-half (&frac12;) of the difference in Revenue between the Parties, and the Party with the lower actual Allowable Expenses will pay to the Party with the higher actual Allowable Expenses one-half (&frac12;) the difference in actual Allowable Expenses between the Parties. The payments due from or to a Party pursuant to this Section ___ may be offset against each other, such that a single payment may be made by one Party to the other Party to fulfill the requirements hereof.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02D"></a>Form 28.02D&mdash;Opt-Out Terms and Consideration</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Either Party may elect to discontinue funding the development and Commercialization of any Collaboration Product at one of the following points with respect to each such Collaboration Product: (a) within ninety (90) days after the Joint Management Committee&rsquo;s decision to proceed with development of the Collaboration Product; (ii) within ninety (90) days after completion of initial testing of the first prototype; or (iii) within ninety (90) days after the decision of the Joint Management Committee to seek Regulatory Approval of the Collaboration Product. Any election to discontinue funding of development or Commercialization of a Collaboration Product must be made in writing and delivered to the other Party within the applicable time period set forth in the preceding sentence. The Party electing to discontinue funding will remain responsible for its share of Allowable Expenses incurred with respect to such Collaboration Product prior to the date of election. Upon one Party&rsquo;s election to discontinue funding of a Collaboration Product, the other Party thereafter will pay royalties to the one Party on Net Sales of that Collaboration Product in accordance with Section ___. If at any time both Parties have elected to discontinue funding of a Collaboration Product, the Joint Management Committee will decide whether to offer the Collaboration Product for license to a Third Party. The Parties will share equally any revenue from such a license. If the Joint Management Committee decides not to license such Collaboration Product to a Third Party or if no good faith negotiation commences with a Third Party within ninety (90) days after the date on which the last Party elected to discontinue funding, then neither Party will have any right to use for any purpose such Collaboration Product, both Parties will retain the Collaboration Product and all associated data and information in confidence in accordance with the terms of Article ___, and any Background Rights specific to such Collaboration Product will be returned to the contributing Party.</p>

After expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party may Exploit Joint Collaboration Patent Rights and Joint Collaboration Technology in any field or territory without approval of or accounting to the other Party.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-4" id="footnote-1931-4-backlink" name="footnote-1931-4-backlink">[4]</a></p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03C"></a>Form 28.03C&mdash;Enforcement of Jointly Owned Collaboration Patent Rights</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party, at its own expense, may initiate an action to enforce a Joint Collaboration Patent Right against accused infringer(s) outside the Collaboration Field. The Party initiating the action will notify the other Party and identify the accused infringer(s). The other Party will cooperate in any such action (a) by agreeing to be named as party to the action solely to the extent necessary to maintain the action, and (b) by not granting any license under the Joint Collaboration Patent Right to the identified accused infringer(s) until after such action is finally resolved. No Party will settle the action without the other Party&rsquo;s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if the terms of settlement would deprive the other Party of its rights in the asserted Joint Collaboration Patent Rights. Any recovery realized as a result of such suit, claim, or action or related settlement will first be applied pro rata to reimburse the Parties&rsquo; reasonable costs and expenses in connection with such suit, claim, or action, and any remaining amounts will be retained by the Party initiating the action. Reasonable expenses not offset will not be Allowable Expenses.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">A Party wishing to enforce a Joint Collaboration Patent Right against infringement in the Collaboration Field will notify the Joint Management Committee (JMC) in writing and identify the accused infringer(s). If the JMC approves of the action, any monetary recovery will be considered Revenue and all reasonable expenses incurred in the enforcement action will be Allowable Expenses. If the enforcement action for infringement in the Collaboration Field is not approved by the JMC, the Party wishing to enforce a Joint Collaboration Patent Right may still bring the action, but such Party will be solely responsible for all expenses incurred in the enforcement action and will be solely entitled to retain any monetary recovery. In either case, the other Party will cooperate in any such action (i) by agreeing to be named as party to the action solely to the extent necessary to maintain the action, and (ii) by not granting any license under the Joint Collaboration Patent Right to the identified accused infringer(s) until after such action is finally resolved. Neither Party will settle the action without the other Party&rsquo;s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if the terms of settlement would deprive the other Party of its rights in the asserted Joint Collaboration Patent Rights.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03D"></a>Form 28.03D&mdash;Prosecution and Maintenance of Jointly Owned Patent Rights</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The Joint Management Committee (JMC) will select mutually acceptable outside counsel to conduct the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of each Joint Collaboration Patent Right under the joint control of both Parties. The outside counsel will prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain all Joint Collaboration Patent Rights in each of the Major Market Countries and such other countries as the JMC may decide, and the reasonable expenses thereof will be Allowable Expenses.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If a Party elects not to share the cost of a Joint Collaboration Patent Right in any country (other than a Major Market Country) or elects to discontinue sharing expenses for any Joint Collaboration Patent Right already filed in any country, such Party will notify the other Party in writing of such election. If the other Party, by written notice, agrees to assume, at its sole expense, the right to file for, prosecute, and maintain such Joint Collaboration Patent Right in such country, the one Party will assign its interest in such Joint Collaboration Patent Right to the other Party and will reasonably assist the other Party in assuming the filing, prosecution, and maintenance of such Joint Collaboration Patent Right in such country. Such Joint Collaboration Patent Right thereafter will be solely owned by the other Party and will no longer be subject to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">With respect to filing, prosecution, and maintenance of each Joint Collaboration Patent Right, the outside counsel will provide to each Party: (i) a copy of the patent application sufficiently prior to filing to permit each Party reasonable opportunity to review and make reasonable comments thereon; (ii) a copy of the patent application promptly after such filing; (iii) copies of all substantive communications received from patent office(s) with respect to such filings; and (iv) copies of all substantive communications to be sent to the patent office(s) with respect to such filings sufficiently before a due date to permit each Party to review and make reasonable comments thereon. Each Party, when requested by the outside counsel, will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the counsel in preparing, filing, or maintaining the patent applications and patents within the Joint Collaboration Patent Rights. The reasonable expenses associated with providing such assistance will be Allowable Expenses.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03E"></a>Form 28.03E&mdash;Allocating Ownership of All Inventions to Single Party</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party agrees that all Collaboration Inventions will be assigned to ALPHA.

<p class="h3"><a name="03F"></a>Form 28.03F&mdash;License Grant for Collaboration Activities</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party hereby grants to the other Party and its Affiliates a worldwide, Co-Exclusive License,<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-5" id="footnote-1931-5-backlink" name="footnote-1931-5-backlink">[5]</a> with the right to grant sublicenses solely as approved by the Joint Management Committee, under its Background Patent Rights, Background Technology, Collaboration Patent Rights and Collaboration Technology in the Collaboration Field solely to the extent necessary for the other Party: (a) to perform its obligations as expressly set forth in this Agreement; and (b) to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Collaboration Products in the Collaboration Field during the term of this Agreement. The license granted in this Section ___ will be royalty-free during the term of this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03G"></a>Form 28.03G&mdash;License for Collaboration Product After Funding Discontinuance</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a Party that elects pursuant to Section ___ to discontinue funding of a Collaboration Product (Discontinuing Party) hereby grants to the other Party upon its election to continue funding the Collaboration Product (Continuing Party) an exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under all Background Patent Rights, Background Technology, Collaboration Patent Rights and Collaboration Technology owned or Controlled by the Discontinuing Party solely to the extent necessary to permit the Continuing Party to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import such Collaboration Product in the Collaboration Field.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="04A"></a>Form 28.04A&mdash;Prosecution of Collaboration Patent Rights</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party will have the exclusive right, but not the obligation, to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain all of its Collaboration Patent Rights. All reasonable costs and fees incurred by a Party in connection with preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of Collaboration Patent Rights in a Major Market Country will be Allowable Expenses. To the extent any Collaboration Patent Right is or becomes necessary for or important to performance by either Party of any aspect of the Collaboration Program or necessary for or important to manufacture or Commercialization of a Collaboration Product, the Party owning such Collaboration Patent Right will exercise commercially reasonable efforts consistent with good faith business practices to maintain Control of such Collaboration Patent Rights.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If a Party elects not to file for a Collaboration Patent Right in a Major Market Country or elects to abandon any Collaboration Patent Right already filed in any country, that Party will notify the other Party in writing not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date such election is irrevocable without additional cost, and will offer the other Party the opportunity to assume, at the other Party&rsquo;s sole expense, the right to file for, prosecute, and maintain such Collaboration Patent Right in such country. If the other Party accepts the offer by written notice to the first Party, the first Party will assign such Collaboration Patent Right to the other Party and will reasonably assist the other Party in assuming the filing, prosecution, and maintenance of such Collaboration Patent Right in such country. Such Collaboration Patent Right thereafter will be the sole property of the other Party and will no longer be subject to this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party will keep the other Party informed of the current status of each patent application that is part of the Collaboration Patent Rights.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="04B"></a>Form 28.04B&mdash;Enforcement of Collaboration Patent Rights</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">A Party will have the exclusive right, but not the obligation, at its sole expense, to enforce outside the Collaboration Field all Collaboration Patent Rights it Controls. The other Party has no obligation to cooperate in or contribute to any such enforcement and will have no right to share in any recovery.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing if it learns of any actual, alleged or threatened infringement of any Collaboration Patent Right by a Third Party in the Collaboration Field. The Party Controlling the affected Collaboration Patent Right will have the first right, but not the obligation, at its own expense, to bring suit (or take other appropriate legal action) against any actual, alleged, or threatened infringement of the Collaboration Patent Right by a Third Party in the Collaboration Field, including the defense and settlement, to the extent such infringement is in the Collaboration Field. If the Controlling Party does not initiate an infringement action or otherwise take affirmative measures to abate any such actual, alleged, or threatened Third-Party infringement of the Collaboration Patent Right within ninety (90) days after receiving a written request from the other Party to take action with respect to such infringement, then the other Party will have the right, but not the obligation, at its own expense, to bring suit (or take other appropriate legal action) against any such actual, alleged, or threatened infringement of the Collaboration Patent Right by a Third Party in the Collaboration Field, including the defense and settlement thereof. In the event either Party brings an infringement action in accordance with this Section ___, such Party will notify the other Party in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing such action and the other Party will provide reasonable assistance and authority to file and bring the action, including, if required to bring such action, being joined as a party plaintiff; <strong>provided</strong>, <strong>however</strong>, that neither Party will be required to transfer any right, title, or interest in or to any of its Collaboration Patent Rights to the other Party or a Third Party to confer standing on a Party hereunder. In addition, if either Party brings an infringement action hereunder, the other Party will have the right to be represented separately in such action by counsel of its own choice, at its own expense. Any recovery realized as a result of such suit, claim, or action or related settlement will first be applied pro rata to reimburse the Parties&rsquo; reasonable costs and expenses in connection with such suit, claim, or action, and any remaining amounts will be Revenue. Reasonable expenses not offset will be Allowable Expenses; <strong>provided</strong>, <strong>however</strong>, that the Party not bringing the infringement action may, by written notice to the other Party within sixty (60) days from receipt of the notice of intent to file such action, elect not to share in the expenses incurred in prosecuting such action, in which event the expenses will not be Allowable Expenses, and the Party electing not to share in expenses will not share in any recovery.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="05A"></a>Form 28.05A&mdash;Provisions Surviving Termination</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Expiration or termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any rights that may have accrued to the benefit of a Party prior to such expiration or termination. Without limiting the foregoing, Articles ____ and Sections ____ will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement to the extent necessary to effect the purposes thereof.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="05B"></a>Form 28.05B&mdash;Accrued Rights on Termination</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-1-backlink" id="footnote-1931-1" name="footnote-1931-1">1</a>] Obviously, in a collaboration specifically directed to development of products from identified biological material, a party may not have any option in that regard.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-2-backlink" id="footnote-1931-2" name="footnote-1931-2">2</a>] See &sect;20.03, <em>supra</em>, regarding force majeure provisions.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-3-backlink" id="footnote-1931-3" name="footnote-1931-3">3</a>] Most pharmaceutical collaborations are worldwide in scope, but milestones are limited to certain events in the United States or another country having not only significant market value but also rigorous regulation. Achieving approval in a country with little or no regulation is of little significance in the major market countries.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-4-backlink" id="footnote-1931-4" name="footnote-1931-4">4</a>] Where a collaboration includes joint funding of developments, each party may have an investment interest in all collaboration technology and patent rights. Thus, even though the collaboration technology is solely owned by one party, the other party may demand the royalty-free right to exploit such technology outside the collaboration field and in the collaboration field after termination of the agreement. Whether or not joint funding is involved, the parties could agree on royalty-bearing licenses under solely owned collaboration technology, particularly where it is being exploited outside the collaboration field.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-5-backlink" id="footnote-1931-5" name="footnote-1931-5">5</a>] The term &ldquo;co-exclusive license&rdquo; has no legally defined meaning and should be defined. It is generally understood to mean that only two parties will have licenses. In terms of enforcing the licensed patent, a &ldquo;co-exclusive&rdquo; license has been held to be merely a non-exclusive license, meaning the &ldquo;co-exclusive&rdquo; licensees would have no standing to enforce the patents. Monsanto Co. v. Aventis Cropscience SA, 226 F. Supp. 2d 531, 539 (D. Del. 2002). The more traditional approach is a grant of an exclusive license with a reservation by the licensor to practice under the licensed patents, but as noted in Chapter 3, <em>supra</em>, the reservation would prevent the exclusive licensee from enforcing the licensed patent without joining the patent owner. See &sect;11.00, <em>supra</em>.</p>
