<p class="h3"><a name="D1"></a>Form D1&mdash;A More Complex Nonexclusive Cross-License Agreement With Royalties on Net Sales</p>
<p class="ddw12">Effective January 1, 20__ (hereafter &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;), ABC Company, a corporation of New York (hereafter ABC), having a principal place of business at _____________, and XYZ Company, a corporation of Delaware (hereafter XYZ), having a principal place of business at ______________, agree as follows:</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article I</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">General<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-1" id="footnote-3118-1-backlink" name="footnote-3118-1-backlink">[1]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">1.01 ABC has numerous patents and maintains extensive continuing development in respect to:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Signal Controlled Traction Equipment (as defined below), and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Components (as defined below) for equipment falling under (a), above.</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.02 ABC represents that it is prepared in respect to its U.S. patents applicable to products named in Section 1.01, above, to grant to any financially responsible applicant a nonexclusive license on proportionately reasonable terms.</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.03 XYZ has certain patents relating to equipment and components of the classes identified in Section 1.01, above, and proposes additional developments in this field. It desires assurance of a license under the applicable patents of ABC.</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.04 The parties, having examined the relative value to each other of their respective relevant patent holdings and their respective levels of technological effort, have found the present balance of value in favor of ABC. In view of this finding, they have jointly concluded that their respective needs and interests will be served by an exchange of licenses supplemented by payment of certain royalties by XYZ to ABC, all under the conditions stated in the remaining Articles of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article II</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Definitions<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-2" id="footnote-3118-2-backlink" name="footnote-3118-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">2.01 ABC and XYZ are hereafter occasionally referred to as &ldquo;Parties&rdquo; (in singular or plural usage, as indicated by the context).</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.02 Terms in this Agreement (other than names of Parties and Article headings) that are set forth in initial capital letters have the meanings established for such terms in this Article II of the Agreement, or, as to certain terms, in Article IV of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.03 &ldquo;Signal Controlled Traction Equipment&rdquo; means equipment for moving loads under the control of remotely generated signals propagated through space. The term includes equipment that is alternatively responsive to local control means provided such equipment also has the remote control capability specified in the preceding sentence. Where load-moving equipment incorporates a number of completely separable load-carrying or traction units, some of which do and some of which do not have the specified remote control capability, the term Signal Controlled Traction Equipment applies only to those units of the complete equipment that have the specified capability.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.04 &ldquo;Components&rdquo; means subassemblies and parts specifically designed and adapted for use in Signal Controlled Traction Equipment. It excludes subassemblies and parts that, although usable in equipment of the named class, are developed or designed for general use or for uses other than in equipment of the named class. It specifically excludes materials, including, but not limited to, plastics, metals, alloys, paints, lubricants, and wire.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.05 &ldquo;Patent&rdquo; means any U.S. patent, other than a design patent, that contains a claim or claims applicable to</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. the design, composition, construction, structure or operation of Signal Controlled Traction Equipment or of Components, or </p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. a machine, instrumentality, or process specifically designed for the development, manufacture, installation, testing, repair, or maintenance of Signal Controlled Traction Equipment or Components.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.06 &ldquo;Licensed Patents&rdquo;<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-3" id="footnote-3118-3-backlink" name="footnote-3118-3-backlink">[3]</a> of a granting Party means all Patents issued or issuing on patent applications filed prior to January 1, 20__, or filed subsequent thereto but receiving, or entitled to receive, the benefit of a filing date prior to January 1, 20__, and as to which the granting Party has the right at any time during the term of this Agreement to grant licenses or releases of the scope or within the scope of the licenses and releases granted in this Agreement. If the grant or exercise of rights under a patent that would otherwise be a Licensed Patent requires or results in the payment of a royalty or penalty or other consideration by a grantor to another (except for payments for inventions made by such other while employed by the grantor), then that patent will not be a Licensed Patent until and unless the Party receiving rights under the patent undertakes to reimburse the grantor for the payment so made.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article III</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">License Grants<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-4" id="footnote-3118-4-backlink" name="footnote-3118-4-backlink">[4]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">3.01 Each Party grants to the other Party under the granting Party&rsquo;s Licensed Patents a nonexclusive license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or otherwise dispose of Signal Controlled Traction Equipment and Components throughout the United States, its territories, and possessions.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.02 The term of the license as to each Licensed Patent is for the full life of the patent.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-5" id="footnote-3118-5-backlink" name="footnote-3118-5-backlink">[5]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">3.03 Nothing in this Agreement is intended to preclude the export or sale for export of products licensed in Section 3.01, and on which, in the case of XYZ, royalties shall have been paid to the extent required by Section 4.01, but no rights are granted or implied in respect to such exported products under any foreign patents of either Party to this Agreement or of any other person.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-6" id="footnote-3118-6-backlink" name="footnote-3118-6-backlink">[6]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">3.04 Subject to full and faithful performance under this Agreement, each Party releases the other Party and all purchasers and users of Signal Controlled Traction Equipment and Components acquired, mediately or immediately, from the released Party from any and all claims, demands, and rights of action that the releasing Party may have on account of any infringement or alleged infringement of any Licensed Patent by the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, import or other disposition of Signal Controlled Traction Equipment or Components that, prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement, were manufactured, used, sold, or otherwise disposed of by the released Party.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-7" id="footnote-3118-7-backlink" name="footnote-3118-7-backlink">[7]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article IV</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Royalties, Reports, and Payments<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-8" id="footnote-3118-8-backlink" name="footnote-3118-8-backlink">[8]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">4.01 XYZ will pay royalties to ABC on Royalty-Bearing Products at the rate of two percent (2%) of the Net Selling Price of all such Products sold or otherwise disposed of subsequent to the Effective Date of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of the five-year period beginning on the Effective Date of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.02 &ldquo;Royalty-Bearing Products&rdquo; means</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Signal Controlled Traction Equipment; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Components sold or otherwise disposed of other than as incorporated parts of Signal Controlled Traction Equipment,</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">that, as sold or otherwise disposed of, (i) come within any claim of an unexpired Licensed Patent of ABC or (ii) are made by use of a process or machine that, at the time of such making, comes within any claim of an unexpired Licensed Patent of ABC.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.03 The expression &ldquo;Royalty-Bearing Products . . . otherwise disposed of&rdquo; means and includes (a) Royalty-Bearing Products not sold but delivered by XYZ to others (including deliveries for export), regardless of the basis of compensation, if any; (b) Royalty-Bearing Products not sold as such but sold by XYZ as components or constituents of other products; and (c) Royalty-Bearing Products put into use by XYZ for any purpose other than routine testing.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.04 &ldquo;Net Selling Price&rdquo; in respect to Royalty-Bearing Products sold means invoice price, f.o.b. factory, after deduction of regular trade and quantity discounts, but before deduction of any other items, including but not limited to freight allowances, cash discounts, and agents&rsquo; commissions.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-9" id="footnote-3118-9-backlink" name="footnote-3118-9-backlink">[9]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">Where Royalty-Bearing Products are not sold, but are otherwise disposed of, Net Selling Price for the purpose of computing royalties will be the Net Selling Price at which products of similar kind and quality, sold in similar quantities, are currently being offered for sale by XYZ. Where such products are not currently being separately offered for sale by XYZ, the Net Selling Price of Royalty-Bearing Products otherwise disposed of will be XYZ&rsquo;s cost of manufacture, determined by XYZ&rsquo;s customary accounting procedures consistently applied, increased by _________ percent (______%).</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.05 In order to assure ABC the full royalty payments contemplated in this Agreement, in the event any Royalty-Bearing Products are sold for resale either (a) to a corporation, firm, or association that, or individual who, owns a controlling interest by stock ownership or otherwise, or (b) to a corporation, firm, or association in which XYZ or its stockholders, directly or indirectly, own a controlling interest by stock ownership or otherwise, the royalties to be paid in respect to such Royalty-Bearing Products will be computed on the Net Selling Price at which the purchaser for resale resells such products rather than on the Net Selling Price of XYZ.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-10" id="footnote-3118-10-backlink" name="footnote-3118-10-backlink">[10]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">4.06 XYZ will make written reports to ABC quarterly within thirty (30) days after the first days of each January, April, July, and October through, and including January 20__, and as of such dates, stating in each such report the number, description, and aggregate Net Selling Prices of Royalty-Bearing Products that were sold or otherwise disposed of during the preceding three (3) calendar months and on which a royalty is payable as provided in this Article IV. The first such report must include all Royalty-Bearing Products so sold or otherwise disposed of between the date of this Agreement and the date of such report.</p>
<p class="ddw12">XYZ will make a written report to ABC within thirty (30) days after the date of any termination by XYZ of any license under a Licensed Patent of ABC received by XYZ under this Agreement, stating in such report the number, description, and Net Selling Prices of all Royalty-Bearing Products sold or otherwise disposed of upon which royalty not previously reported to ABC is payable solely in consequence of such Licensed Patent.</p>
<p class="ddw12">Concurrently with the making of each report, XYZ will pay to ABC royalties at the rate specified in this Article IV. Royalty-Bearing Products shall be considered to be sold when billed out, except that upon expiration of any Licensed Patent covering such Royalty-Bearing Products, or upon any termination of a license, all shipments made on or prior to the date of such expiration or termination that have not been billed out prior thereto will be considered as sold (and therefore subject to royalty). Royalties paid on Royalty-Bearing Products that are not accepted by the customer may be credited by XYZ against royalties due, provided each report provides the basis for any such credits.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.07 In case the royalties otherwise payable to ABC under this Agreement fail to aggregate a minimum of ten thousand U.S. dollars ($10,000) for each calendar year during the life of this Agreement, XYZ will, within thirty (30) days of the end of the year in which the failure occurs, pay ABC such additional sum as may be necessary to bring the payment for such year up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000).<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-11" id="footnote-3118-11-backlink" name="footnote-3118-11-backlink">[11]</a> Failure to pay any necessary additional sum will be a material breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.08 XYZ will keep records showing the Royalty-Bearing Products sold or otherwise disposed of by it under the license granted in Article III, such records to be in sufficient detail to enable the royalties payable to ABC to be determined. XYZ will also permit its books and records to be examined from time to time to the extent necessary to verify the reports provided for in Section 4.06, such examination to be made, no more frequent than once per calendar year, at the expense of ABC by an independent auditor appointed by ABC who must retain in confidence information learned during such examination and who will report to ABC only the amount of royalty payable for the period under audit. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, ABC may have a final audit conducted by an independent auditor appointed by ABC and paid by ABC.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article V</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Representations and Warranties; Limitations<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-12" id="footnote-3118-12-backlink" name="footnote-3118-12-backlink">[12]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">5.01 Subject to limitations on the meaning of Licensed Patents established by Section 2.06 of this Agreement, each of the Parties represents and warrants that</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. it has not accepted and will not accept any commitments or restrictions in respect to its right to grant licenses that will materially affect the value of the rights granted by it in this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. it will, as far as it is reasonably practicable for it to do so, cause its employees who are employed to do research, development, or other inventive work to disclose to it inventions within the scope of this Agreement and to assign to it rights in such inventions such that the other Party receives, by virtue of this Agreement, the licenses agreed to be granted to it.</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.02 Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. a warranty or representation by either Party as to the validity or scope of any Licensed Patent; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. a warranty or representation that anything made, used, sold, or otherwise disposed of under any license granted in this Agreement is or will be free from infringement of patents of third persons; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. a requirement that either Party file any patent application, secure any patent, or maintain any patent in force; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">d. an obligation to bring or prosecute actions or suits against third parties for infringement of any patent; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">e. an obligation to furnish any manufacturing or technical information, or any information concerning pending patent applications; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">f. conferring a right to use in advertising, publicity, or otherwise any trademark or trade name of the Party from which a license is received under the Agreement; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">g. granting by implication, estoppel, or otherwise any licenses or rights under patents other than Licensed Patents.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-13" id="footnote-3118-13-backlink" name="footnote-3118-13-backlink">[13]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article VI</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Transferability of Rights and Obligations<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-14" id="footnote-3118-14-backlink" name="footnote-3118-14-backlink">[14]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">6.01 Any license or release granted by this Agreement by a Party in respect to a Licensed Patent will be binding on any successor of the Party in ownership or control of the Licensed Patent.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.02 The obligations of XYZ to make reports, pay royalties, and maintain records in respect to any subsisting license under this Agreement will run in favor of any person or legal entity that is a successor or assignee of ABC in respect to ABC&rsquo;s benefits under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.03 The licenses received by any Party under this Agreement will pass to any assigns for the benefit of creditors of the licensed Party, and to any receiver of its assets, or to any person or corporation succeeding to its entire business in Licensed Products as a result of sale, consolidation, reorganization, or otherwise, provided such assignee, receiver, person, or legal entity, without delay, accepts in writing the provisions of this Agreement and agrees to become in all respects bound thereby in the place and state of the licensed Party, but the licenses may not otherwise be transferred without the written consent of the licensing Party.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article VII</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Term and Termination<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-15" id="footnote-3118-15-backlink" name="footnote-3118-15-backlink">[15]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">7.01 The word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; and cognate words, such as &ldquo;term&rdquo; and &ldquo;terminate,&rdquo; used in this Article VII are to be read, except where the contrary is specifically indicated, as omitting from their effect the following rights and obligations, all of which will survive any termination to the degree necessary to permit their complete fulfillment or discharge:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. XYZ&rsquo;s obligation to supply a terminal report in respect to terminated licenses as specified in Section 4.06 of this Agreement;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. ABC&rsquo;s right to receive or recover and XYZ&rsquo;s obligation to pay royalties (including minimum royalties) accrued or accruable for payment at the time of any termination;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. XYZ&rsquo;s obligation to maintain records and ABC&rsquo;s right to conduct a final audit as provided in Section 4.08 of this Agreement;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">d. licenses and releases running in favor of customers or transferees of either Party in respect to products sold or transferred by that Party prior to termination of this Agreement or of any license arising under this Agreement (subject, in the case of XYZ, to payment of any royalties payable in respect to such products); and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">e. any cause of action or claim of either Party, accrued or to accrue, because of any breach or default by the other Party.</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.02 Unless otherwise terminated as provided in Section 7.03 or 7.04, this Agreement shall run to the end of the life of the last to expire of the Licensed Patents and shall thereupon terminate.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-16" id="footnote-3118-16-backlink" name="footnote-3118-16-backlink">[16]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">7.03 XYZ may prospectively terminate this Agreement or its license and concomitant future obligations in respect to any Licensed Patents upon thirty (30) days&rsquo; advance written notice to ABC. Such termination will not terminate the license granted to ABC under XYZ&rsquo;s Licensed Patents.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-17" id="footnote-3118-17-backlink" name="footnote-3118-17-backlink">[17]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">7.04 A Party may terminate the license granted to the other Party if the other Party asserts, after the Effective Date, the invalidity of any claim of any Licensed Patent licensed to the other Party. Such termination will be effective on notice to the other Party if such assertion is made in a complaint filed in a court, whether or not the other Party continues to otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement. If such assertion is made without filing a complaint in court to that effect, and the assertion is coupled with or followed by withholding, notice of intention to withhold, or denial of obligation to pay, royalties otherwise payable under this Agreement in respect to operations under such claim asserted to be invalid, such termination will be effective thirty (30) days after notice unless, within the 30-day period, the other Party, in writing, withdraws the assertion and resumes compliance with all royalty payment terms. An assertion of invalidity of a claim of a Licensed Patent without the filing a complaint in court and without withholding or otherwise denying an obligation to pay agreed-upon consideration will not constitute a basis for termination.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-18" id="footnote-3118-18-backlink" name="footnote-3118-18-backlink">[18]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">7.05 With respect to acts of XYZ other than those set forth in Section 7.03, ABC may terminate this Agreement at any time in the event of a default by XYZ in the due observance or performance of any covenant, condition, or limitation of this License Agreement required to be performed by XYZ, but only if XYZ does not remedy its default within thirty (30) days after receipt from ABC of written notice of such default. Termination of XYZ&rsquo;s license rights pursuant to this Section 7.05 will not terminate ABC&rsquo;s license rights granted under XYZ&rsquo;s Licensed Patents.</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.06 If, in any proceeding in which the validity, infringement, or priority of invention of any claim of any Licensed Patent licensed to XYZ is in issue, a judgment or decree is entered that becomes not further reviewable through the exhaustion of all permissible applications for rehearing or review by a superior tribunal, or through the expiration of the time permitted for such applications (hereinafter referred to as an &ldquo;irrevocable judgment&rdquo;), the construction placed on any such claim by such irrevocable judgment will thereafter be followed, not only as to such claim but as to all claims to which such construction applies, with respect to acts occurring thereafter; and, if such irrevocable judgment holds any claim invalid, XYZ will be relieved thereafter from including in its reports apparatus sold or otherwise disposed of thereafter covered only by such claim or by any broader claim to which such irrevocable judgment is applicable, and from the performance of those other acts that may be required by this Agreement only because of any such claim; provided, however, that if there are two or more conflicting irrevocable judgments with respect to the same claim, the decision of the higher tribunal shall be followed thereafter, but if the tribunals be of equal dignity, then the decision more favorable to the claim will be followed until the less favorable decision has been followed by the irrevocable judgment of another tribunal of at least equal dignity. In the event of conflicting irrevocable judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States, the latest shall control.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-19" id="footnote-3118-19-backlink" name="footnote-3118-19-backlink">[19]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article VIII</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Notices; Applicable Law; Arbitration<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-20" id="footnote-3118-20-backlink" name="footnote-3118-20-backlink">[20]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">8.01 Any notice, report, or payment provided for in this Agreement will be deemed sufficiently given when sent by certified or registered mail addressed to the Party for whom intended at the address given at the outset of this Agreement or at such changed address as the Party shall have specified by written notice.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.02 This Agreement will be construed, interpreted, and applied in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.03 Any controversy or claim arising under or related to this contract insofar as it involves or is limited to a question of infringement of any claim or claims of a Licensed Patent will be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Patent Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with those rules, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.04 This instrument contains the entire and only Agreement between the parties and supersedes all preexisting Agreements between them respecting its subject matter. Any representation, promise, or condition in connection with such subject matter that is not incorporated in this Agreement shall not be binding on either Party. No modification, renewal, extension, waiver, or (except as provided in Article VII hereof) termination of this Agreement or any of its provisions will be binding on the Party against whom enforcement of such modification, renewal, extension, waiver, or termination is sought, unless made in writing and signed on behalf of such Party by one of its executive officers, or in the case of ABC, by the Manager of its Licensing Operation. As used herein, the word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; includes any and all means of bringing to an end, prior to its expiration by its own terms, this Agreement, or any provision thereof, whether by release, discharge, abandonment, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be executed and duly sealed in duplicate originals by its duly authorized representative.</p>

<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, ABC owns U.S. Patent No. 1,234,567 to Smith et al. as amended by Reexamination Certificate No. B1 1,234,567 (hereafter &ldquo;the &lsquo;567 Patent&rdquo;) relating to gas transformer (GT) technology; and</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, XYZ owns U.S. Patent No. 1,234,900 to Jones et al., which also relates to GT technology; and</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, XYZ desires to practice its GT technology without expending the cost to determine with certainty whether products incorporating that technology might infringe the &lsquo;567 Patent or other ABC patents that rely on the &lsquo;567 Patent for priority; and</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, ABC also owns other U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that are directed to inventions having application in systems employing GT technology that ABC can license without accounting to others, and XYZ wants an option for a license under such other patents and applications; and</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, ABC, as part of its effort to promote use of GT technology, is willing to grant to XYZ a royalty-bearing, nonexclusive license under the &lsquo;567 Patent and a nonexclusive option for a comparable license under the other patents and applications.</p>

<p class="ddw12">2.1 ABC hereby grants to XYZ a nonexclusive license, with no right to grant sublicenses, under the Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Licensed Products solely in the Licensed Field.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.2 XYZ agrees that it will not practice under the Licensed Patents outside the Licensed Field, except to the extent otherwise licensed by ABC in another agreement.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-24" id="footnote-3118-24-backlink" name="footnote-3118-24-backlink">[24]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">2.3 ABC hereby grants a license of the same scope as granted in paragraph 2.1 to any XYZ Related Company that agrees in a written document delivered to ABC to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article III&mdash;Option</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.1 ABC hereby grants to XYZ a nonexclusive option for a nonexclusive license under one or more of the Optional Patents to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products covered thereby as part of Licensed Products<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-25" id="footnote-3118-25-backlink" name="footnote-3118-25-backlink">[25]</a> sold by XYZ in the Licensed Field.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.2 XYZ may exercise the option granted in paragraph 3.1 by written notice received by ABC before midnight on December 31, 20__. Such notice must specify the Optional Patents listed in Attachment A that XYZ wishes to include in the license.

The mere listing of a patent or application in Attachment A does not grant any license or right, express or implied, to XYZ; a license under such patents or applications may be obtained only by compliance with the terms of paragraph 3.2 hereof.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.4 ABC further agrees to add to Attachment A, by written notice to XYZ, any patent or patent application (a) that is acquired or filed by it before January 1, 20__, (b) that claims an invention having any application in the Licensed Field, and (c) under which ABC has the right to grant licenses without accounting to others.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.5 ABC&rsquo;s disclosure of pending applications as required under paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 hereof shall be conditioned on the existence of and subject to a confidential disclosure agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article IV&mdash;Consideration</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.1 For each Licensed Product made, sold, or otherwise disposed of by or for XYZ or an XYZ Related Company in a country in which a Licensed Patent remains valid, enforceable, and unexpired, XYZ will pay to ABC ___________ U.S. dollars ($_______) per Ton and a proportional amount for any fraction of a Ton.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.2 In the event XYZ, in order to sell a Licensed Product, is required to pay a royalty to a third party pursuant to a patent license agreement negotiated at arm&rsquo;s length,<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-26" id="footnote-3118-26-backlink" name="footnote-3118-26-backlink">[26]</a> XYZ may credit fifty percent (50%) of the royalty paid to such third party for a Licensed Product against the royalty payable pursuant to paragraph 4.1 hereof. Notwithstanding any credit permitted pursuant to this paragraph, in no event will the royalty payable pursuant to paragraph 4.1 for a Licensed Product be less than ___________ U.S. dollars ($_______) per Ton (the &ldquo;Minimum Rate&rdquo;). The credit provided by this paragraph will be effective only for Licensed Products sold after the royalty required by the license from such third party is effective. XYZ must provide ABC with written notice of such a requirement within thirty (30) days after it becomes effective, such notice to include the name of the third party, the patent(s) under which royalties are being paid to the third party, and the Licensed Product part or component to which the third-party patent(s) apply.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-27" id="footnote-3118-27-backlink" name="footnote-3118-27-backlink">[27]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">4.3 In the event XYZ exercises the Option granted in Article III hereof,</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. the royalty rate specified in paragraph 4.1 will increase to ___________ U.S. dollars ($_______) per Ton for all Licensed Products sold or otherwise disposed of by XYZ or an XYZ Related Company after the effective date, as specified in paragraph 3.2, of the optional license; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. the Minimum Rate specified in paragraph 4.2 will increase to ___________ U.S. dollars ($_______) per Ton.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.4 The royalty rates specified in paragraphs 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 must be adjusted annually beginning on January 1, 20__, to reflect any increase or decrease in the Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials, Supplies and Components, Commodity Code 10-6 &ldquo;Heating Equipment&rdquo; as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;).

<p class="ddw12">4.5 The phrase &ldquo;otherwise disposed of&rdquo; as used in conjunction with a Licensed Product means (a) a Licensed Product not sold but delivered by or for XYZ or an XYZ Related Company to others (including deliveries for export) regardless of the basis for compensation, if any, and (b) a Licensed Product put into use by XYZ or an XYZ Related Company for any purpose licensed hereunder other than routine testing. Routine testing will include field testing only if such field testing is directly performed by XYZ or an XYZ Related Company and the Licensed Product used for such field testing is owned by XYZ or the XYZ Related Company.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.6 A Licensed Product will be considered sold on the date of shipment or the date of an invoice, whichever is earlier. A Licensed Product will be considered otherwise disposed of on the date of shipment. Only one royalty will be due for each Licensed Product. A royalty will be paid pursuant to paragraph 4.1 usually on the sale or other disposition of a Licensed Product, but a royalty must be paid on the manufacture of a Licensed Product if (a) the Licensed Product is sold or otherwise disposed of in a country where no Licensed Patent remains valid, enforceable, and unexpired, or (b) the Licensed Product was made but not sold or otherwise disposed of prior to termination pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph 4.7 hereof.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.7 Within thirty (30) days after June 30 and December 31 of each calendar year, XYZ must send to ABC a written report setting forth the Licensed Products, and the Tons thereof, sold or otherwise disposed of during the preceding six months. The first such report will include all Licensed Products sold or otherwise disposed of since the effective date of this Agreement. A report will be sent to ABC even when no Licensed Products were sold or otherwise disposed of during the period subject to the report. Each such report must be accompanied by payment of the royalties due pursuant to paragraph 4.1 hereof. A final report must be sent to ABC within sixty (60) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement specifying Licensed Products sold or otherwise disposed of since the immediately preceding report and Licensed Products made but not sold or otherwise disposed of as of the date of termination or expiration, and payment for all such Licensed Products must accompany the final report.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.8 XYZ must keep and cause XYZ Related Companies to keep good and accurate books of account sufficient to permit determination of the royalties due hereunder and will make such books of account available for inspection by an independent accountant designated by ABC and reasonably acceptable to XYZ. Such inspections will be no more frequent than once each calendar year during the term hereof and once within six months after termination of this Agreement. The designated accountant will retain in confidence the information in the books of account and will report to ABC only the accuracy or inaccuracy of the reports rendered pursuant to paragraph 4.7 hereof. Such inspections will be at ABC&rsquo;s expense unless the designated accountant identifies underpayment of royalties due by ten percent (10%) or more, in which event XYZ will pay for such inspection up to a maximum of $_____. ABC&rsquo;s failure to inspect will not constitute a waiver of ABC&rsquo;s right to object to the accuracy of the reports rendered or payments made under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article V&mdash;Term and Termination</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.1 This Agreement will expire on expiration of the last to expire of the Licensed Patents unless extended or earlier terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.2 This Agreement will automatically terminate in the event (a) the assets of XYZ are seized or attached in conjunction with any action against it by a third party, or (b) XYZ is dissolved or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets is made for the benefit of creditors, or (c) an attempt to assign this Agreement is made contrary to the terms of this Agreement. Except where this Agreement is assigned to an XYZ Related Company in conjunction with its sale as provided in paragraph 8.1 hereof, this Agreement will automatically terminate as to any XYZ Related Company on the day such company ceases to satisfy the definition in paragraph 1.4.</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.3 This Agreement may be terminated by either Party for a material breach by the other Party of the provisions hereof. Such termination will be effective sixty (60) days after written notice to the other Party of the breach if the breach has not been remedied. Failure to make timely reports and payments as required by paragraph 4.4 will be a material breach.</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.4 In the event of termination of this Agreement, XYZ may complete all contracts for the sale of Licensed Products under which XYZ is obligated on the date of termination provided XYZ pays royalties on such sales as required in Article IV hereof and provided all such sales are completed within six (6) months after the date of termination.</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.5 The right of either Party to terminate under the provisions of this Article will not be an exclusive remedy, and either Party will be entitled, if the circumstances warrant, alternatively or cumulatively, to damages for breach of this Agreement, to an order requiring performance of the obligations of this Agreement, or to any other legally available remedy.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article VI&mdash;Further Licenses and Technical Assistance</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.1 The license granted herein is limited to the Licensed Patents and the Licensed Field, and under this Agreement no license is granted under any other patent or technology now or hereafter owned by ABC or for practice in any other field. During negotiations of this Agreement, the parties discussed and negotiated available licenses under other ABC patents and technology, and to the extent any understanding was reached, it will be the subject of a separate agreement signed by both parties.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-29" id="footnote-3118-29-backlink" name="footnote-3118-29-backlink">[29]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">6.2 ABC has no obligation to provide to XYZ any manufacturing or technical information or any technical assistance. Upon request by XYZ and subject to good-faith negotiations, ABC will provide research and development services to XYZ to the extent ABC is able and has the time.</p>

<p class="ddw12">7.1 XYZ must mark all Licensed Products on a visible surface thereof or, if impractical, on tags, labels, manuals, and other materials with which Licensed Products are sold, with the applicable numbers of the Licensed Patents.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article VIII&mdash;Assignment<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-31" id="footnote-3118-31-backlink" name="footnote-3118-31-backlink">[31]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">8.1 This Agreement has been entered into by ABC in reliance on the particular qualifications of XYZ and is personal to XYZ. Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned, pledged, or encumbered by XYZ or any XYZ Related Company without the express prior written approval of ABC. The preceding notwithstanding, XYZ, without the permission of ABC, may assign this Agreement and the rights granted herein (a) to a third party in conjunction with the sale or transfer to the third party of substantially all of the assets of XYZ associated with performance under this Agreement, or (b) to an XYZ Related Company in conjunction with the sale of such XYZ Related Company to a third party. Except for XYZ Related Companies while controlled by XYZ, in no event shall there be more than one licensee having rights granted under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.2 ABC may assign, pledge, or encumber its monetary rights under this Agreement and may assign the Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder in conjunction with the sale of the Licensed Patents.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article IX&mdash;Infringement<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3118-32" id="footnote-3118-32-backlink" name="footnote-3118-32-backlink">[32]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">9.1 XYZ must notify ABC of any third party XYZ believes may be infringing a Licensed Patent and must provide to ABC any information XYZ has in support of such belief. ABC may, but will not be obligated to, use such information in an infringement action against such third party. XYZ agrees to cooperate with ABC in any action for infringement of a Licensed Patent brought by ABC, and ABC will reimburse XYZ for all reasonable costs incurred by it in providing cooperation requested by ABC.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article X&mdash;Miscellaneous</p>
<p class="ddw12">10.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and merges and supersedes all prior discussions, negotiations, understandings, and agreements between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof. Neither Party will be bound by any definition, condition, warranty, right, duty, or covenant other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as subsequently set forth in a written document signed by both parties.

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3118-27-backlink" id="footnote-3118-27" name="footnote-3118-27">27</a>] For discussion of reach through royalties, see Section 12.01B3, <em>supra</em>.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3118-28-backlink" id="footnote-3118-28" name="footnote-3118-28">28</a>] See &sect;12.06 <em>supra</em> for alternative inflation adjustment provisions.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3118-29-backlink" id="footnote-3118-29" name="footnote-3118-29">29</a>] Such disclaimers are important where a licensee declines a license under related patents. As discussed in &sect;6.05 <em>supra</em>, it is not clear such a disclaimer would be effective to preclude legal estoppel. In this form, the additional patents are identified and a disclaimer based on that should be effective.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3118-30-backlink" id="footnote-3118-30" name="footnote-3118-30">30</a>] See &sect;20.02 <em>supra</em> for alternative provisions.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3118-31-backlink" id="footnote-3118-31" name="footnote-3118-31">31</a>] See Chapter 15 <em>supra</em>. See also Chapter 23 <em>supra</em> for the bankruptcy consequences of such an assignment provision</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3118-32-backlink" id="footnote-3118-32" name="footnote-3118-32">32</a>] More extensive protection for the licensee is discussed in Chapter 14 <em>supra</em>.</p>
