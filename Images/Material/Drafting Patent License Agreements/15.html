<div class="ddw18">Chapter 15: Transferability of Rights and Obligations of License Agreements</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 15.00A&mdash;Assignment at Will</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Either Party may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to any third party at any time, provided the assigning Party obtains and delivers to the other Party a written agreement by the third party to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement that apply to the assigning Party.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 15.00B&mdash;Assignment at Will (Alternate)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Either Party may assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder to any third party at any time, provided the assigning Party obtains and delivers to the other Party a written agreement by the third party to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement that apply to the assigning Party. Receipt by the non-assigning party of such written agreement by the third party will, as of the date of such third party agreement, discharge the assigning party of any of its remaining obligations under this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 15.00C&mdash;No Assignment</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Neither Party may assign this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent and acceptance of the other Party, which consent and acceptance will not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld. Any assignment consented to hereunder will not be effective until the assigning Party obtains and delivers to the other Party a written agreement by the third party to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement that apply to the assigning Party. Any attempted assignment without such written consent will be void and invalid.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 15.00D&mdash;Reasonable Withholding of Consent</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">While acknowledging that there may be many reasonable bases for refusing to consent to an assignment of this Agreement, the Parties agree it would be reasonable for the Licensor to withhold consent for assignment of this Agreement by Licensee to a Competitor. For purposes of this Section __, a &ldquo;Competitor&rdquo; is a third party that, at any time prior to the proposed assignment, manufactured or sold products, that in any relevant market, compete with products sold by Licensor.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="00E"></a>Form 15.00E&mdash;Reasonable Withholding of Consent (Alternate)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The Parties agree that, among other reasonable bases for refusing to consent to an assignment of this Agreement, a Party may refuse to consent to assignment of this Agreement to an Adverse Party. For purposes of this Section __, an &ldquo;Adverse Party&rdquo; is an entity currently engaged in, or has threatened in the past year to engage in, litigation or an administrative proceeding against such Party or its Affiliates. Each Party agrees, upon reasonable request from the other Party, to identify from a list of not more than ten entities, any entity then deemed to be an Adverse Party.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 15.01A&mdash;Assignor Representation 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Assignor represents that it has not granted any licenses to anyone under the Assigned Patent.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 15.01B&mdash;Assignor Representation 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Assignor represents that the only agreements remaining in effect as of the date hereof that grant licenses under the Assigned Patent are identified in Schedule A attached hereto and that Assignee has been given access to a true copy of each such agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01C"></a>Form 15.01C&mdash;Assignment of Licensed Patent 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor will not assign a Licensed Patent independently of this Agreement, but Licensor may assign all Licensed Patents to a third party to whom Licensor assigns this Agreement pursuant to Section __ hereof.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="01D"></a>Form 15.01D&mdash;Assignment of Licensed Patent 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The license granted in this Agreement will be binding on any successor of Licensor in ownership or Control<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-1" id="footnote-1931-1-backlink" name="footnote-1931-1-backlink">[1]</a> of the Licensed Patents, and Licensor will assign to such successor all of Licensor&rsquo;s rights and obligations under this Agreement pertaining to such Licensed Patents, including the right under Article __ to receive from Licensee reports and royalties and the obligation under Section __ to maintain and enforce the Licensed Patents.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02"></a>Form 15.02&mdash;Assignment by Licensor</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor may assign its rights under this Agreement to any third party, provided, if the assignment requires Licensee to render performance to the third party, it will not be effective until Licensee has received notice thereof. Notwithstanding any assignment of its rights, Licensor may only assign its obligations under this Agreement with the prior written approval of Licensee, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment of such obligations without Licensee&rsquo;s prior approval will be void.</p>
                
                
<p class="h3"><a name="03A"></a>Form 15.03A&mdash;Assignment by Licensee</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The rights and licenses granted by Licensor in this Agreement may be assigned or otherwise transferred by Licensee without the consent of Licensor. As a condition to effectiveness of any such assignment, Licensee must obtain from any assignee of this Agreement a written agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon receipt of such agreement, Licensor will accept the assignee as a substitute for Licensee with respect to all rights and obligations. Any attempted assignment without express agreement by the assignee to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be void and without effect.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03B"></a>Form 15.03B&mdash;Assignment With Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Business</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The rights and licenses granted by Licensor in this Agreement are personal to Licensee and may not be assigned or otherwise transferred without the written consent of Licensor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, Licensee may assign this Agreement and the license granted herein in conjunction with a merger, consolidation, or the sale or transfer of substantially all of Licensee&rsquo;s assets associated with performance under this Agreement.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-2" id="footnote-1931-2-backlink" name="footnote-1931-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03C"></a>Form 15.03C&mdash;Additional Limitation of Licensee&rsquo;s Assignment</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In no event, however, may the granted license be assigned to or run in favor of a person who or corporation that, prior to the date of this Agreement, was engaged in substantial production or sale of devices competitive with the Licensed Products.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03D"></a>Form 15.03D&mdash;Termination for Change of Control</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor may terminate this Agreement, at Licensor&rsquo;s sole discretion, by delivery of written notice to Licensee upon the sale or transfer of a majority of the voting shares of Licensee to a person or entity not currently an Affiliate of Licensee.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="03E"></a>Form 15.03E&mdash;Definition of Change of Control</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Change of Control&rdquo; means:</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">(a) an acquisition of any voting securities of Licensee by any &ldquo;Person&rdquo; (as the term person is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), immediately after which such Person has &ldquo;Beneficial Ownership&rdquo; (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 50% or more of the combined voting power of Licensee&rsquo;s then outstanding Voting Securities; provided, however, in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, Voting Securities which are acquired in a &ldquo;Non-Control Acquisition&rdquo; (as hereinafter defined) will not constitute an acquisition which would cause a Change in Control. A &ldquo;Non-Control Acquisition&rdquo; means an acquisition by (A) an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof or a trustee thereof acting solely in its capacity as trustee) maintained by Licensee or any corporation or other Person of which a majority of its voting power or its voting equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by Licensee (for purposes of this definition, a Subsidiary), (B) Licensee or its Subsidiaries, or (C) any Person who files in connection with such acquisition a Schedule 13D which expressly disclaims any intention to seek control of the Company and does not expressly reserve the right to seek such control; provided, however, that any amendment to such statement of intent which either indicates such an intention or reserves the right to seek control will be deemed an &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; of the securities of Licensee reported in such filing as beneficially owned by such Person for the foregoing purposes;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">(b) the individuals who, as of the Effective Date, are members of the Board of Licensee (the Incumbent Board), ceasing for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if the election, or nomination for election by the Licensee&rsquo;s common shareholders, of any new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Board, such new director, for purposes of the Agreement, will be considered a member of the Incumbent Board; or</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">(c) the consummation of any of the following transactions as entered into by Licensee:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(i) a merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Licensee, unless such merger, consolidation or reorganization is a &ldquo;Non-Control Transaction&rdquo; i.e., meets any of the requirements described in (A) or (B) below:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">(A) the stockholders of Licensee, immediately before such merger, consolidation, or reorganization, own, directly or indirectly, immediately following such merger, consolidation, or reorganization, at least eighty percent (80%) of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or reorganization (the Surviving Corporation) in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the Voting Securities immediately before such merger, consolidation, or reorganization; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">(B) the individuals who were members of the Incumbent Board immediately prior to the execution of the agreement providing for such merger, consolidation, or reorganization constitute at least two-thirds of the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the consummation of such merger, consolidation, or reorganization;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(ii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of Licensee; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(iii) an agreement for the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Licensee or the business of Licensee associated with performance under this Agreement, to any Person (other than a transfer to a Subsidiary).</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Notwithstanding the foregoing, it will not be a Change in Control solely because any Person (the Subject Person) acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the outstanding Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by Licensee which, by reducing the number of Voting Securities outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Voting Securities by the Company, and after such, a Beneficial Owner acquires additional Voting Securities which increase the percentage of the then outstanding Voting Securities beneficially owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in Control will have occurred.</p>
