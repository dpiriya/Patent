<div class="ddw18">Appendix J: Simple Collaboration Agreement</div>

<p class="ddw12">IN THIS COLLABORATION AGREEMENT (Agreement), effective as of this ____ day of ____________, 20___ (Effective Date), Alpha Corporation (ALPHA), a Delaware corporation, having offices at __________________ and Beta Corporation (BETA), having offices at __________________ (hereafter collectively Parties and individually Party), agree as follows:</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 1&mdash;Background of Agreement</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.1 BETA has DNA samples (the &ldquo;Samples&rdquo;) and relevant patient medical information collected from a study demonstrating the efficacy of agent A in the treatment and prevention of coronary disease. The study (4,000 samples) concerns use of Agent A in reducing risk of heart attack in patients with high triglyceride levels who had not yet suffered an attack.</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.2 ALPHA has technology and expertise in identifying biomarkers having therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic value.</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.3 ALPHA desires BETA to test the Samples for markers that correlate with patient clinical phenotype and agent A response and other clinical end points in such a way as to be useful for BETA&rsquo;s new drug discovery efforts, and ALPHA is willing to perform such service in exchange for the right to use the Samples for development of diagnostic, pharmacogenomic, and research products.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 2&mdash;Research</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.1 ALPHA and BETA will jointly agree upon the scope of each Party&rsquo;s responsibility pursuant to this Agreement (&ldquo;Research Plan&rdquo;). The Research Plan will define primary genotyping assays to be performed by ALPHA on all or a specified part of the Samples based on specified lists of candidate genes. The Research Plan will permit ALPHA, upon completion of the primary genotyping assays, to perform additional studies (for example, replication studies) using the Samples or data therefrom.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.2 The Research Plan will be agreed upon prior to execution of this Agreement and will be attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A. During the term of this Agreement, the Parties may amend the Research Plan by written addenda signed by both Parties and included in Exhibit A. The Research Plan is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.3 On or before ______, 20___, BETA will deliver to ALPHA in an agreed-upon form and by an agreed-upon method the Samples coded to preserve patient anonymity and all relevant patient medical information associated therewith. The Samples and patient information will be BETA Confidential Information subject to the terms of Article 5.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.4 BETA and ALPHA will share applicable genotyping and clinical information and statistical analyses in order to facilitate efficient and successful genotyping as outlined in the Research Plan. In addition to information and analyses applicable to primary genotyping assays, BETA will share with ALPHA clinical information that may assist ALPHA in performing studies and analyses of interest to ALPHA as outlined in the Research Plan. Each Party may identify any such information and analyses as Confidential Information, subject to the terms of Article 5.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.5 Each Party will disclose to the other all genotyping results contemplated by the Research Plan. All such results will be Confidential Information of the disclosing Party.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.6 Each Party will perform its obligations under the Research Plan at its own expense.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 3&mdash;IP Rights</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.1 Each Party will retain ownership of all information and materials in its possession as of the date of execution of this Agreement and of any intellectual property rights therein (&ldquo;Background Rights&rdquo;). Each Party will receive and may use the other Party&rsquo;s Background Rights solely as specifically permitted by this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.2 All conceptions, ideas, innovations, discoveries, inventions, compositions, biological material, and methods, whether or not patentable or susceptible to any other form of legal protection, that are made or derived by a Party during performance under the Research Plan (&ldquo;Program Technology&rdquo;) and all rights therein will be owned by that Party.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.3 The Party owning Program Technology, at its sole expense, will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain appropriate intellectual property protection for such Program Technology (&ldquo;IP Rights&rdquo;). That Party will notify the other Party of all actions and communications regarding obtaining or maintaining IP Rights sufficiently in advance to permit the other Party to comment thereon. In the event the Party owning the Program Technology elects not to pursue IP Rights for any part thereof, it will so inform the other Party and will permit the other Party, at its election and expense, to pursue such IP Rights. The Party owning the Program Technology will assign to the other Party any IP Rights obtained by the other Party pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and all Program Technology to which such IP rights are directed.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.4 ALPHA hereby grants to BETA and its Affiliates a worldwide, exclusive license under Program Technology and IP Rights for discovery, development, regulatory approval, manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, and import of therapeutic products having application in the treatment of disease (&ldquo;BETA Field&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.5 BETA hereby grants to ALPHA and its Affiliates a worldwide, exclusive license under Program Technology and IP Rights for discovery, development, regulatory approval, manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, and import of any product or service for amplification, detection, quantification, extraction, or sequencing of a nucleic acid or polypeptide for the purpose of diagnosing, detecting, or monitoring a disease, state, condition, trait, or characteristic of a human being, including identifying a predisposition to disease, predicting treatment responsiveness, or monitoring the progress of disease or treatment (&ldquo;ALPHA Field&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.6 ALPHA, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees, upon request by BETA to facilitate BETA in its internal research and development in the BETA Field by supplying to BETA assays and associated technology for use in such internal research and development on terms and conditions agreed to by the Parties.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.7 ALPHA hereby covenants not to enforce any of its Background Rights against activities of BETA pursuant to the Research Plan or authorized pursuant to Section 3.4 or 3.6.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.8 BETA hereby covenants not to enforce any of its Background Rights against activities of ALPHA pursuant to the Research Plan or authorized pursuant to Section 3.5.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 4&mdash;Consideration</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.1 In consideration for the efforts of ALPHA pursuant to the Research Plan, BETA will pay to ALPHA a royalty of ___________ percent (___ %) of the Net Sales of any product derived from use of gene targets identified during performance of the Research Plan (&ldquo;Licensed Product&rdquo;). As to each Licensed Product, the obligation to pay royalties will begin on first commercial sale of the Licensed Product and will end on the tenth (10th) anniversary of that first commercial sale.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.2 &ldquo;Net Sales&rdquo; means:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) The gross invoiced price of Licensed Products sold by or for BETA to a third party in an arm&rsquo;s-length transaction, less the following, to the extent charged as part of the invoiced price, separately stated on the invoice and paid by or credited to, as the case may be, the third party:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">(i) credits, allowances, discounts, and rebates to, and charge backs from the account of, third parties for spoiled, damaged, outdated, rejected, or returned Licensed Products;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">(ii) actual freight, postage, transportation, and insurance costs incurred in delivering Licensed Products;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">(iii) reasonable and customary cash, quantity, and trade discounts actually given to third parties;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">(iv) sales, use, value-added, and other direct taxes to the extent billed to and paid by the third party; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">(v) customs duties, surcharges, and other governmental charges incurred in connection with the exportation or importation of Licensed Products.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) With respect to Combination Products (as defined below), the gross invoiced price of such Combination Products billed to third parties by or for BETA, less: the allowances and adjustments referred to in Sections 4.2(a)(i)&ndash;(v), multiplied by the fraction A/A+B, where A is the gross selling price of the Licensed Product sold separately during the royalty period in question, and B is the gross selling price of the other therapeutically active ingredients in the Combination Product sold separately during the royalty period in question. If there is no established current gross selling price for the Licensed Product A or for the other active ingredients B, then for the purposes of calculating Net Sales, the fraction will be X/X+Y, where X is the Direct Cost to BETA for the Licensed Product and Y is the direct cost to BETA of the other active ingredients. For purposes of this Agreement, &ldquo;Combination Product&rdquo; means a Licensed Product that is sold together in combination with one or more other active ingredients. &ldquo;Direct Cost&rdquo; means only direct costs as determined using the generally accepted accounting principles used by BETA, consistently applied.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(c) Net Sales will not include Licensed Products used in clinical trials, for research or other noncommercial uses, or supplied as commercial samples or as charitable or humanitarian donations, so long as BETA receives no compensation in any form for such use/donation.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.3 Royalties will be calculated on a quarterly basis and payable within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, based upon Net Sales during the previous calendar quarter. BETA will pay all royalties due to ALPHA by wire transfer as directed by ALPHA in writing from time to time. BETA will furnish to ALPHA, at the same time as each royalty payment is due, a written report for the calendar quarter upon which the royalty payment is based that includes the Net Sales of each Licensed Product, the royalty due and payable, and the manner in which the royalty payments were calculated.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.4 BETA will keep full and accurate books of account containing all particulars that may be necessary for the purpose of calculating all royalties payable to ALPHA. Such books of account will be kept at BETA&rsquo;s principal place of business and, with all necessary supporting data, will, for the three (3) years next following the end of the calendar year to which each pertains, be open for inspection by an independent certified accountant retained by ALPHA and reasonably acceptable to BETA, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours for the sole purpose of verifying royalty statements or compliance with this Agreement, but in no event more than once in each calendar year. All information and data offered will be used only for the purpose of verifying royalties and will be treated as BETA Confidential Information subject to the obligations of this Agreement. In the event that such inspection indicates that, in any calendar year, the royalties which should have been paid by BETA are at least five percent (5 %) greater than those which were actually paid by BETA, then BETA will pay the cost of such inspection.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.5 Remittance of royalties payable on Net Sales of Licensed Products will be payable to ALPHA in U.S. dollars calculated at the sell rate of exchange for the currency received as of the first banking day of the calendar quarter in which the Net Sales were made, as reported in the Wall Street Journal. If the transfer of or the conversion into United States dollars of any such remittance in any such instance is not lawful or possible, the payment of royalties will be made by the deposit thereof, in the currency of the country where Net Sales of Licensed Products were made, to the credit and account of ALPHA&rsquo;s choice located in that country, prompt notice of which will be given by BETA to ALPHA</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.6 Any amount not being paid to ALPHA when due will bear interest at a rate of three percent (3%) over the prime rate then offered by Citibank N.A. from the due date until paid.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.7 Any tax imposed under the laws of any foreign country on royalties or fees payable pursuant to Article 4, to the extent ALPHA, under applicable tax treaties, may credit such taxes against its tax payments to the United States, will be promptly paid by BETA for and on behalf of ALPHA to the appropriate governmental authority, and BETA will furnish ALPHA with proof of payment of such tax, together with copies of all returns, reports, or other fillings made with the appropriate government authority, and copies of all communications from such authority with respect to such tax. Any such tax actually paid on ALPHA&rsquo;s behalf may be deducted from royalty payments due ALPHA. BETA will cooperate with ALPHA in seeking lawfully to reduce or recover any such taxes withheld. BETA may not deduct from royalty payments due any taxes paid that ALPHA may not credit against its United States taxes.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 5&mdash;Confidential Information</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.1 During the term of this Agreement, it is contemplated that each Party will disclose to the other or will develop during the course of performance of this Agreement proprietary information. All information disclosed by a Party to the other that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and all information developed during performance under this Agreement will be &ldquo;Confidential Information.&rdquo; Each Party will retain the other Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose any such Confidential Information to a third party without the prior written consent of the Party providing such information and will use the other Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information only for the purposes of this Agreement, which obligation will terminate five (5) years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">5.2 The obligations of confidentiality will not apply to Confidential Information which the receiving Party can show by documentary evidence:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) was known to the receiving Party or generally known to the public prior to its disclosure hereunder; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) subsequently becomes known to the public by some means other than a breach of this Agreement; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(c) is subsequently disclosed to the receiving Party by a third party having a lawful right to make such disclosure.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Specific aspects or details of Confidential Information will not be deemed to be within the public domain merely because the Confidential Information is embraced by general disclosures in the public domain. In addition, any combination of Confidential Information will not be considered in the public domain merely because individual elements thereof are in the public domain unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 6&mdash;Term and Termination</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.1 The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will end on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the first commercial sale of the last Licensed Product derived by or for BETA from use of gene targets identified during performance of the Research Plan.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.2 ALPHA may terminate this Agreement at any time after completion of the Research Plan on ninety (90) days&rsquo; advance written notice to BETA. Such termination will not terminate the rights of BETA granted pursuant to Sections 3.4, 3.6, and 3.7 or the obligations of BETA imposed by Section 3.3 and Articles 4 and 5 to the extent of any Program Technology made during performance of the Research Plan.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.3 BETA may terminate this Agreement at any time after completion of the Research Plan on ninety (90) days&rsquo; advance written notice to ALPHA. Such termination will not terminate the rights of ALPHA granted pursuant to Sections 3.5 and 3.8 or the obligations of ALPHA imposed by Section 3.3 and Article 5 to the extent of any Program Technology made during performance of the Research Plan.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.4 Either party may terminate this Agreement on the liquidation, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the other Party or the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the property of the other Party, or if the other Party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, whether any of the aforesaid events are the outcome of a voluntary act or otherwise. In the event a Party files for bankruptcy and the debtor or trustee rejects this Agreement, the other Party may elect to retain its rights under this Agreement upon appropriate written notification to the trustee. All rights and licenses granted hereunder or pursuant to this Agreement are, for all purposes of Section 365(n) of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11), licenses of rights to &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; as defined in Title 11.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.5 If a Party fails to perform any material term of this Agreement, then the other Party may give written notice of termination to the breaching Party. If the breach identified in the notice is not cured by the breaching Party within sixty (60) days after the effective date of the notice of breach, this Agreement will automatically terminate. Upon such termination, the other Party will retain the rights and obligations as specified in Section 6.2 or 6.3 as applicable.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.6 In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.5 for breach by BETA, BETA will have the right to complete all contracts for the sale of Licensed Products under which BETA is obligated on the date of termination provided BETA pays royalties on such sales as required in Article 4 hereof and provided all such sales are completed within six (6) months after the date of termination.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.7 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein to the contrary, each Party upon termination of this Agreement will discontinue use of the Program Technology of the other Party and the other Party&rsquo;s Background Technology, and, within thirty (30) days after termination, ALPHA will return to BETA all of the Samples that are unused.</p>
<p class="ddw12">6.8 The right of either Party to terminate under the provisions of this Article 6 will not be an exclusive remedy, and either Party will be entitled, if the circumstances warrant, alternatively or cumulatively, to damages for breach of this Agreement, to an order requiring performance of the obligations of this Agreement, or to any other legally available remedy.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 7&mdash;Representations and Warranties</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.1 Each Party hereby represents and warrants to other Party that it has full authority and power to enter into this Agreement and to grant the rights, covenants, and licenses specified herein, that it has secured any and all necessary approvals, permits, or consents deemed necessary or advisable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, that it is not a party to and will not become a party to any agreement with another that is inconsistent with this Agreement, and that upon execution by the Party this Agreement will immediately be a valid and binding obligation of the Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.2 Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) a warranty or representation by either Party as to the validity, enforceability, or scope of any patent; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) a warranty or representation that anything made, used, sold, or otherwise disposed of pursuant to this Agreement is or will be free from infringement of patents or other intangible rights of third parties; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(c) a requirement that either Party will file any patent application, secure any patent, or maintain any patent in force; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(d) an obligation on either Party to bring or prosecute actions or suits against third parties for infringement of any patent; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(e) an obligation to furnish any manufacturing or technical information except as specifically provided herein; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(f) granting any right to either Party to use in any way the name of, or any trademark of, the other Party;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(g) granting by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right under patents, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, or other intangible rights of either Party other than as expressly provided in Article 3.</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.3 EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, AND RENOUNCES ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES, RIGHTS, AND REMEDIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY LAW OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE USEFULNESS OR FREEDOM FROM DEFECTS OF PROGRAM TECHNOLOGY OR LICENSED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, (a) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS, (b) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING, OR USAGE IN THE TRADE, AND (c) ANY OBLIGATION, RIGHT, LIABILITY, CLAIM, OR REMEDY FOR (1) LOSS OF USE, REVENUE, OR PROFIT OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, (2) INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTANGIBLE PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND (3) INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Article 8&mdash;Miscellaneous</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior agreements, understandings, writings, and discussions between the Parties relating to said subject matter.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.2 This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument executed by the Parties. The failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any condition or term in any one or more instances will be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or term or any other condition or term.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.3 This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and to the extent elsewhere provided herein, will inure to the benefit of ALPHA&rsquo;s Affiliates.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.4 Any delay in or failure of performance by either Party under this Agreement will not be considered a breach of this Agreement if and to the extent caused by occurrences beyond the reasonable control of the Party affected, including but not limited to acts of God; acts, regulations, or laws of any government; strike or other considered acts of workers; fires; floods; explosions; riots; wars; rebellion; and sabotage; and any time for performance hereunder will be extended by the actual time of delay caused by such occurrence.

Termination hereunder will not affect the other Party&rsquo;s rights under the Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.5 This Agreement will not be assignable by either Party without the other Party&rsquo;s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, except that a Party may assign this Agreement to its Affiliate or to a successor in connection with the merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or that portion of its business pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement, with prompt written notice to other Party.</p>
<p class="ddw12">8.6 This Agreement will be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of ___________, without giving effect to conflict of laws, and the parties hereto hereby consent to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of _________ in connection with any dispute arising out of or concerning this Agreement.</p>
