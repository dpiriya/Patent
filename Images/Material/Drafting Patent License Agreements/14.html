<div class="ddw18">Chapter 14: Protection for a Nonexclusive Licensee</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 14.00A&mdash;Most Favored Licensee Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">1. If, after the Effective Date, Licensor grants to any manufacturer or seller of Licensed Products other than an Affiliate of Licensor, a license that is under any U.S. letters patent licensed in this Agreement and that will permit such manufacturer or seller to manufacture or sell products licensed in this Agreement for any use within the scope of the license granted in this Agreement at rates of royalty that, calculated on an equivalent basis in respect to the letters patent in question, are lower than those provided in this Agreement, then Licensor will</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. promptly notify Licensee of such license, and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. extend to Licensee the lower royalty rates of the noticed license, effective as of the date on which they became effective in respect to the noticed license.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">2. The provisions of Section 1, above, will not apply to any release of claims for past infringement in a settlement of an action for infringement of any U.S. letters patent licensed in this Agreement. To the extent such a settlement grants prospective rights, the provisions of Section 1 will apply to that aspect of the settlement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">3. The provisions of Section 1, above, will not apply in respect to any license granted by Licensor the consideration for which consists in whole or in part of patent rights or other rights of such substantial value as, in the judgment of Licensor, to warrant a reduction in royalty rates below the rates provided in this Agreement, or the acceptance of such rights in lieu of royalties.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 14.00B&mdash;Most Favored Licensee Provision (Alternate)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If Licensor hereafter grants to any manufacturer or seller of Licensed Products other than an Affiliate of Licensor, a license that is under any U.S. letters patent licensed in this Agreement and that will permit such manufacturer or seller to manufacture or sell products licensed in this Agreement for any use within the scope of the license granted in this agreement</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. At rates of royalty that, calculated on an equivalent basis in respect to the letters patent in question, are lower than those provided in this Agreement, or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">2. On prospectively operative financial terms, other than royalty rates, corresponding to prospectively operative financial terms established in this Agreement and more favorable to the licensee than those provided in this Agreement,</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">then Licensor will</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Promptly notify Licensee of such license and upon request deliver a true copy thereof to Licensee, and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Extend to Licensee the lower royalty rates or other more favorable financial terms of the noticed license, effective as of the date (or dates) on which they became effective in respect to the noticed license.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Such extension of lower royalty rates or other more favorable financial terms will be effective, however, only if Licensee, within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice referred to in provision a, above, advises Licensor in writing that it accepts all terms of the noticed license that are more favorable to Licensor than corresponding terms of this Agreement and that are brought to the attention of Licensee in the notice referred to.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">This Section will not apply to any release of claims for past infringement in a settlement of an action for infringement of any U.S. letters patent licensed in this Agreement and will not apply to any compulsory license or on-going royalty arrangement mandated by a court or government agency.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 14.00C&mdash;Most Favored Licensee Provision (Alternate)</p>
<p class="ddw12">Licensor agrees that if it should hereafter grant to any third party in competition with Licensee, other than a wholly or partially owned subsidiary or affiliate of Licensor or the U.S. government or any agency, or division thereof, a different license under the Licensed Patents, providing for a more favorable royalty rate to manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, and import the same Licensed Products, Licensee will be entitled to such a more favorable royalty rate.</p>
<p class="ddw12">The royalty rate is defined in paragraph ___ of this Agreement as five percent (5%) of the Net Sales Price of the Licensed Products and the term royalty rate for purposes of this provision relates to no other compensation, licensed technology, term, obligation, or condition in this or in any license hereafter granted. If any license hereafter granted provides for any monetary compensation to Licensor in addition to the royalty rate defined above or grants additional technology, such other monetary compensation will not be regarded as justification for any reduction in royalty rate in the later license and such other technology licensed will not be regarded as justification for a reduction in royalty rate of this license.</p>
<p class="ddw12">If a subsequent license provides only for a lump-sum payment by that licensee and does not include a royalty rate as defined above, Licensee will have a right to accept such lump-sum payment with credit against such payment for all royalties previously paid, Licensee therefore to pay only the difference between the lump sum and the total of the royalties paid by Licensee.</p>
<p class="ddw12">Licensor is obligated to disclose to Licensee the entirety of any subsequent license granted within thirty (30) days after execution of such subsequent license. Within sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice, Licensee must elect by written notice to the terms of the subsequent license. Licensee will forfeit its rights hereunder if it fails to make such a timely election.</p>
<p class="ddw12">Licensor, upon receipt of the written notice from Licensee as required by the preceding paragraph, will amend this Agreement with one containing any more favorable royalty rate to be effective as of the effective date of such different license. If Licensee elects to accept a lower royalty rate or a lump sum, Licensee also must accept all terms and conditions of the subsequent license that Licensee is capable of accepting.</p>
<p class="ddw12">This provision will not apply to forgiveness for past infringements to reach settlement of a lawsuit or genuine dispute between Licensor and a third party with respect to the Licensed Patents; provided, however, that this provision will apply to any license granted for future use by a third party whether in settlement of a dispute or not, except to the extent limited above. This provision will not apply to compulsory licenses or to licenses in effect granted by a court that refuses to enjoin infringement of a Licensed Patent.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 14.01A&mdash;Third-Party Infringement Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In the event that at any time hereafter there is not pending a suit by Licensor against an infringer of the Licensed Patents in the Licensed Territory and Licensed Field based on infringement of such scale that if licensed on the terms herein imposed the annual royalty return to Licensor would be at least five thousand dollars ($5,000) per year, then if any person or concern without a license or right under the Licensed Patents produces or sells in the Licensed Territory and Licensed Field products coming within the definition of Licensed Products, and if:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. Licensee gives Licensor written notice that such production or sale has infringed a claim or claims of a Licensed Patent; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">2. Licensee requests in writing that suit be brought under the Licensed Patent so infringed against such person or concern because of such infringement; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">3. Licensee supplies Licensor with an opinion from the Jones and Jones law firm that such person or concern is infringing a Licensed Patent; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">4. Licensor fails to bring such suit under some one or more of the Licensed Patents or to obtain discontinuance of such infringement within ninety (90) days after receipt of Licensee&rsquo;s request under subparagraph 2; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">5. Sales of the person or concern of such products are of such volume as to produce, if licensed, royalties of at least five thousand dollars ($5,000) per year,</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">then, in such case, Licensee will be permanently relieved of the payment of royalties that would otherwise accrue from the time conditions 1 through 5 are all satisfied until the day Licensor brings suit against an infringer or obtains discontinuance of such infringement, with respect only as to the Licensed Patents so alleged to be infringed.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 14.01B&mdash;Third-Party Infringement Provision (Alternate Remedy)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">then, in such case, Licensee will have the right to file suit against an infringer, at Licensee&rsquo;s expense and for Licensee&rsquo;s benefit. Licensor consents to be a party and to cooperate with Licensee in any such suit brought by Licensee pursuant to this paragraph. Licensee will be relieved of 50% of royalties accruing under this Agreement during pendency of such suit with respect only to the Licensed Patents so alleged to be infringed.</p>
