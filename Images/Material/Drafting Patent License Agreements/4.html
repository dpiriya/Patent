<div class="ddw18">Chapter 4: Express Agreements: Nonexclusive Licenses, Nonassertion Agreements, and Exclusive Licenses</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="01"></a>Form 4.01&mdash;Nonexclusive License Grant</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">LICENSOR grants to LICENSEE a nonexclusive license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products embodying or made in accordance with the inventions claimed in the LICENSED PATENTS.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 4.02A&mdash;Covenant Not to Sue</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Company A hereby covenants not to sue Company B under any patent listed in Exhibit A for infringement based upon any act by Company B of manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or import that occurs after the effective date of this Agreement. Company A hereby represents that it owns full legal and equitable title to each patent listed in Exhibit A. Company A further promises to impose the covenant of this paragraph on any third party to whom Company A may assign a patent listed in Exhibit A.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 4.02B&mdash;Nonassertion Clause in License Agreement</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor will not assert against Licensee, or its direct or indirect customers, any claim for infringement of any U.S. patent that Licensor now or hereafter owns or can license to others, based on the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or import of any Licensed Product made or sold by Licensee under the license granted in this Agreement and upon which royalty has been paid in accordance with the provisions of Article ___.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1873-1" id="footnote-1873-1-backlink" name="footnote-1873-1-backlink">[1]</a></p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02C"></a>Form 4.02C&mdash;Limit on Scope of Nonassertion Agreement</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">This agreement of nonassertion will apply only to patents that claim such Licensed Product or its use. This agreement of nonassertion will not apply to patents that claim an apparatus or method for making the Licensed Product unless such apparatus or method is the only way to make such Licensed Product.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02D"></a>Form 4.02D&mdash;Assignment of Covenant Not to Sue</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The covenant not to sue granted in this Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by Company B to any third party without the prior written permission of Company A, which permission will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Company B may assign this Agreement and the covenant not to sue without permission of Company A to any Company B Affiliate or to any third party that acquires the business of Company B associated with activities subject to the covenant not to sue.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02E"></a>Form 4.02E&mdash;Extend Nonassertion to Customers</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Company A further covenants not to sue or bring, prosecute, assist or participate in any judicial, administrative or other proceeding against any person under any patent listed in Exhibit A for infringement based upon use, offer for sale or sale of any product that is (a) subject to the covenant not to sue granted to Company B herein, and (b) acquired, directly or indirectly, from Company B by that person.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03A"></a>Form 4.03A&mdash;Representation of No Prior Licenses</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor represents and warrants that it owns the Licensed Patents and that, prior to the date of this Agreement, no license or covenant not to sue under any Licensed Patent has been granted to any third party.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03B"></a>Form 4.03B&mdash;Sublicense Rights in an Exclusive License<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1873-2" id="footnote-1873-2-backlink" name="footnote-1873-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">1. Licensor hereby grants to Licensee the exclusive right under the Licensed Patents to grant sublicenses to others at royalty rates not less than those required to be paid in Article ___ of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">2. In respect to sublicenses granted by Licensee under this Article&nbsp;___, Licensee will pay over to Licensor that proportion of royalties received from its sublicensees necessary to yield Licensor returns on Licensed Products sold by such sublicensees equal to the amounts that it would have received from Licensee on equivalent Licensed Products sold by it.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1873-3" id="footnote-1873-3-backlink" name="footnote-1873-3-backlink">[3]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">3. Termination under any of the provisions of Article ___ of the license granted to Licensee in this Agreement will terminate all sublicenses that may have been granted by Licensee, provided that any sublicensee may elect to continue its sublicense by advising Licensor in writing, within sixty (60) days of the sublicensee&rsquo;s receipt of written notice of such termination, of its election, and of its agreement to assume in respect to Licensor all the obligations (including obligations for payment) contained in its sublicensing agreement with Licensee. Any sublicense granted by Licensee must be in writing and must contain provisions corresponding to those of this paragraph respecting termination and the conditions of continuance of sublicenses.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">4. The granting by Licensee of sublicenses under the Licensed Patents will be in the discretion of Licensee, and Licensee will have the sole power to determine whether or not to grant sublicenses, the identity of sublicensees, and subject to paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article, the royalty rates and terms and conditions of such sublicenses.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03C"></a>Form 4.03C&mdash;Minimum Annual Royalty Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If royalties paid to Licensor under this Agreement do not aggregate a minimum of $__ for the calendar year ending December 31, 20__, and the same amount for each succeeding calendar year during the continuance of the Agreement, Licensor may at its option terminate the Agreement and the licenses granted in it by providing Licensee with notice of termination within thirty (30) days after receipt of the last report for any calendar year in respect to which failure to pay the prescribed minimum occurs, unless Licensee, within thirty (30) days from the date of such notice, pays Licensor such additional sum as may be necessary to bring the payment for such calendar year up to the specified minimum.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03D"></a>Form 4.03D&mdash;Conversion to Nonexclusive</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In the event royalties payable to Licensor under this Agreement for the calendar year 20__ or for any subsequent calendar year during the life of the Agreement do not equal or exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), Licensor will have the right, upon sixty (60) days&rsquo; notice, to convert the license granted in Article __ from exclusive to nonexclusive. Licensee may maintain the exclusive character of its license, notwithstanding any such notice from Licensor, if it, prior to expiration of the sixty (60) day notice period, pays to Licensor a sum that, when added to the royalties payable for the year in question, totals one thousand dollars ($1,000). Failure of Licensor to give the notice provided in this Article __ in reference to any given year or years will not constitute a waiver of the right to give such notice in reference to any subsequent year.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03E"></a>Form 4.03E&mdash;Disclaimer of Obligation to Exploit</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Licensee will not have any obligation to make, use, sell, import, offer for sale, or promote any Licensed Product. Nothing in this Agreement or in the relationship between the parties will be construed to impose such an obligation on Licensee.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1873-4" id="footnote-1873-4-backlink" name="footnote-1873-4-backlink">[4]</a></p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03F"></a>Form 4.03F&mdash;Assignment of Exclusively Licensed Patent</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor may assign any Licensed Patent to any third party at any time without prior notice to Licensee, provided, however, that Licensor also assigns to such third party all causes of action, rights and remedies arising under such Licensed Patent after the Effective Date and prior to the date of such assignment and requires such third party to accept the obligations in Section __ hereof with respect to such Licensed Patent. Licensor will provide Licensee with written notice of the assignment within thirty (30) days after it is effective.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1873-1-backlink" id="footnote-1873-1" name="footnote-1873-1">1</a>] The final phrase, conditioning the nonassertion on payment of royalties, may be ineffective. See Tessera, Inc. v. Int&rsquo;l Trade Comm., 646 F.3d 1357, 98 USPQ2d 1868 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that sale under a license exhausts the licensed patents even though royalties were unpaid and despite contract language to the effect that such products are not licensed until royalties are paid).</p>


<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1873-2-backlink" id="footnote-1873-2" name="footnote-1873-2">2</a>] Of all conceivable allocations of the sublicensing power, this one seems to introduce fewer practical and legal complications, and is therefore ordinarily to be recommended.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1873-3-backlink" id="footnote-1873-3" name="footnote-1873-3">3</a>] There is, of course, no obstacle to reducing this requirement to something less than 100% parity if it is in the licensor&rsquo;s interest to provide incentive for sublicensing in order to maximize overall returns from the licensed patents, and in some circumstances there may conceivably be antitrust considerations favoring this approach. See, for example, the &ldquo;competitive advantages&rdquo; viewpoints discussed in Western Geophysical Co. of America v. Bolt Associates, 305 F. Supp. 1248, 162 USPQ 502 (D. Conn. 1969), modified, 305 F. Supp. 1251, 164 USPQ 277 (D. Conn. 1969).</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1873-4-backlink" id="footnote-1873-4" name="footnote-1873-4">4</a>] No matter how thorough the disclaimer, a disappointed licensor may institute a lawsuit seeking damages for failure to exploit the licensed technology. See Flight Concepts L.P. v. Boeing Co., 819 F. Supp. 1535 (D. Kan. 1993), aff&rsquo;d, 38 F.3d 1152 (10th Cir. 1994).</p>
