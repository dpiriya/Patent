<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-1-backlink" id="footnote-1931-1" name="footnote-1931-1">1</a>] A defined term used to avoid repeating &ldquo;owned or licensable by a party.&rdquo; A common definition is:</p>
<p class="footnote">Form 27.03G&mdash;Definition of Controlled</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Control&rdquo; and cognates thereof means, with respect to Technology, Patent Rights, and/or Proprietary Information, ownership or the possession of the ability to grant licenses or sublicenses or to otherwise disclose, without violating the terms of any agreement or other arrangement with, or the rights of, any Third Party.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-2-backlink" id="footnote-1931-2" name="footnote-1931-2">2</a>] The proposed definition broadly encompasses any information disclosed to the other party regardless of the nature of disclosure or the character of the information. More commonly, the information, to be within the scope of proprietary information, must be identified as confidential at the time of disclosure, marked as confidential if disclosed in a tangible form, and, if disclosed orally or by demonstration, summarized in a document that is marked as proprietary within a specified period of time after disclosure. Many companies resist the latter because rarely is any oral disclosure confirmed in writing. Both parties, however, will recognize the value of limiting their obligations to information tangibly identified as proprietary; each party would then be capable of identifying what is subject to control under the agreement.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-3-backlink" id="footnote-1931-3" name="footnote-1931-3">3</a>] The exception to proprietary information based on independent development may be of problematic value given the difficulty in proving the basis for the exception. It is always difficult to prove a negative.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-4-backlink" id="footnote-1931-4" name="footnote-1931-4">4</a>] This &ldquo;sum of the parts does not equal the whole&rdquo; qualification may be particularly important where the proprietary information resides in the manner in which many otherwise known parts or features are combined to achieve a valuable purpose.</p>
                    
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-5-backlink" id="footnote-1931-5" name="footnote-1931-5">5</a>] Disclaimers of the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular use, in any way connected to the sale of goods, should be conspicuous (preferably in all capital letters) to be effective. U.C.C. &sect;2-316 (2003). Also, to disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability, merchantability must be specifically mentioned. While the UCC is not applicable to technology license agreements if only rights to technology are being transferred, it has become common practice to include in license agreements disclaimers of the type necessary to be effective under the UCC.</p>
