<div class="ddw18">Chapter 12: Royalties, Reports, and Payments</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 12.01A&mdash;Value-Added Royalty Base</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Royalty Base&rdquo; means a finished consumer product as Sold by or for the Licensee that includes a Licensed Product integrated with additional components, features, and functionality. By way of example, the Royalty Base includes televisions, cell phones, video games consoles, computers, and other finished products that include at least one Licensed Product and that are Sold in the form that will be used by the ultimate consumer.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 12.01B&mdash;&ldquo;Net Selling Price&rdquo; Defined</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Net Selling Price&rdquo; for the purpose of computing royalties under this Agreement means Licensee&rsquo;s invoice price, f.o.b. factory, after deduction of regular trade and quantity discounts, but before deduction of any other items, including but not limited to freight allowances, cash discounts, and agents&rsquo; commissions.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01C"></a>Form 12.01C&mdash;&ldquo;Net Sales Price&rdquo; Defined (Alternate)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Net Sales Price&rdquo; shall mean Licensee&rsquo;s invoice price, less those taxes, duties, and shipping charges separately stated on the invoice.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01D"></a>Form 12.01D&mdash;Intracorporate Sales Transactions</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In order to assure to Licensor the full royalty payments contemplated in this agreement, Licensee agrees that in the event any Royalty-Base Products are sold for purposes of resale either (1) to a corporation, firm, or association that, or individual who, owns a controlling interest in Licensee by stock ownership or otherwise, or (2) to a corporation, firm, or association in which Licensee or its stockholders own a controlling interest by stock ownership or otherwise, the royalties to be paid in respect to such Royalty-Base Products will be computed on the Net Selling Price at which the purchaser for resale sells such Products rather than on the Net Selling Price of Licensee.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01E"></a>Form 12.01E&mdash;Royalties for Transactions Not Arm&rsquo;s Length</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In order to insure to Licensor the full royalty payments contemplated hereunder, Licensee agrees that, in the event any Royalty-Based Products are sold (1) to a Related Company of Licensee or (2) to a corporation, firm, or association with which, or individual with whom, Licensee or its stockholders or Related Companies have any agreement, understanding, or arrangement (such as, among other things, an option to purchase stock, or an arrangement involving a division of profits or special rebates or allowances) without which agreement, understanding, or arrangement, prices paid by such corporation, firm, association, or individual for the apparatus licensed hereunder would be higher than the Net Selling Price reported by Licensee, or if such agreement, understanding, or arrangement results in extending to such corporation, firm, association, or individual lower prices for Royalty-Base Products than those charged to outside concerns buying similar merchandise in similar amounts and under similar conditions, then, and in any such events, the royalties to be paid hereunder in respect of such Royalty-Base Products will be based on the Net Selling Price at which the purchaser of such Royalty-Base Products so sold resells such Royalty-Base Products, rather than on the Net Selling Price of Licensee; provided, however, that Licensee will not be obligated under the foregoing to pay royalty based on selling prices in excess of the standard Net Selling Price at which it or any of the organizations or individuals associated with it as specified in this section shall set such apparatus to any wholly independent jobber or distributor.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01F"></a>Form 12.01F&mdash;Complex Net Sales Definition</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&ldquo;Net Sales&rdquo; means:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(a) The gross invoiced price of a Licensed Product sold by or for Licensee to a Third Party, less the following, to the extent charged as part of the invoiced price, separately stated on the invoice and paid by or credited to, as the case may be, the Third Party:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(i) credits, allowances, discounts, and rebates to, and charge backs from the account of, the Third Party for spoiled, damaged, outdated, rejected, or returned Licensed Products;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(ii) actual freight, postage, transportation, and insurance costs incurred in delivering Licensed Products;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(iii) reasonable and customary cash, quantity, and trade discounts actually given to the Third Party;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(iv) sales, use, value-added, and other direct taxes to the extent billed to and paid by the Third Party; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(v) customs duties, surcharges, and other governmental charges incurred in connection with the exportation or importation of Licensed Products.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(b) In the case of a sale, loan, lease, consignment, distribution, or transfer of Licensed Products that are not sold in an arm&rsquo;s-length transaction to a Third Party, the Net Sales will be the Average Net Sales (as such term is defined below) for sales to end users for such Licensed Product calculated under subsection (a) of this Section&nbsp;__. Without limiting the foregoing, Net Sales will be calculated as set forth in this subsection (b) in the event of any sale, loan, lease, consignment, gift, distribution, or other transfer (i) to an end user that is Licensee itself, an Affiliate, or a distributor; (ii) to an end user that enjoys a special course of dealing with one or more of the Licensee, an Affiliate, or distributor; or (iii) under an arrangement by which the end user does not pay cash for the Licensed Product or pays cash for a Licensed Product bundled with another product of Licensee without any allocation of the payment among the bundled products (&ldquo;Bundled Product&rdquo;). As used herein the term &ldquo;Average Net Sales&rdquo; means (x) the average Net Sales (as calculated for transfers under subsection (a) of this Section __), over the one-year period preceding the date of transfer that is within subsection (b) of this Section __, of the same type and model of product (as the case may be) and in the same country as such transferee; (y) if such one-year average Net Sales data is unavailable, then the Licensee&rsquo;s, Affiliate&rsquo;s, or distributor&rsquo;s published list price of such product for end users in such country as the transferee; or (z) or if data is unavailable under part (x) or (y), then the fair market value (with reference to the sales price of comparable products).</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(c) With respect to Combination Products, the gross invoiced price of such Combination Products billed to a Third Party by or for Licensee, less: the allowances and adjustments referred to in subsections (a)(i)&ndash;(v) above, multiplied by the fraction A/A+B, where A is the gross selling price of the Licensed Product sold separately during the royalty period in question, and B is the gross selling price of the other product(s) in the Combination Product having significant, independent utilities sold separately during the royalty period in question and that are not covered by Valid Claims of the Licensed Patents or employing the Licensed Technology. If there is no established current gross selling price for the Licensed Product A or for the other product(s) B, then for the purposes of calculating Net Sales, &ldquo;A&rdquo; will be Licensee&rsquo;s fully burdened cost of goods of the Licensed Product and &ldquo;B&rdquo; will be Licensee&rsquo;s fully burdened cost of goods of all other products included in the Combination Product. Such fully burdened cost of goods shall be calculated in accordance with Licensee&rsquo;s standard and documented accounting practices and in any event in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). For purposes of this Agreement, &ldquo;Combination Product&rdquo; means a Licensed Product that is sold packaged, blended, or otherwise inseparably combined with one (1) or more other products having significant independent utility and not covered by a Valid Claim of the Licensed Patents or employing the Licensed Technology. A Combination Product is not a Bundled Product.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(d) With respect to a Licensed Product for which the gross invoiced price includes an amount to compensate Licensee for the amortized cost of instrumentation, services, or other equipment related to use of the Licensed Product that was supplied without charge to a customer under an arrangement that allows the customer to pay for such instrumentation, services, or other equipment over time as part of the purchase price of the Licensed Products (collectively a &ldquo;Plan Product&rdquo;), the Net Sales of such Plan Products will first be calculated in accordance with the definition of Net Sales under subsection (a) of this Section __ and then will be reduced by the amount of the price increase reasonably and demonstrably attributable solely to the amortized cost of the instrumentation, equipment, and service which are provided to customers free of charge, in accordance with GAAP of Licensee consistently applied.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01G"></a>Form 12.01G&mdash;Royalties on Other Dispositions of Licensed Products</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Where products are not sold, but are otherwise disposed of, the Net Selling Price of such products for the purposes of computing royalties will be the selling price at which products of similar kind and quality, sold in similar quantities, are currently being offered for sale by Licensee. Where such products are not currently being offered for sale by Licensee, the Net Selling Price of products otherwise disposed of, for the purpose of computing royalties, will be the average selling price at which products of similar kind and quality, sold in similar quantities, are then currently being offered for sale by other manufacturers. Where such products are not currently sold or offered for sale by Licensee or others, then the Net Selling Price, for the purpose of computing royalties, will be Licensee&rsquo;s cost of manufacture, determined by Licensee&rsquo;s customary accounting procedures, plus ____ percent (____%).</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01H"></a>Form 12.01H&mdash;Royalties on &ldquo;Otherwise Disposed Of&rdquo; Products</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The expression &ldquo;Licensed Products otherwise disposed of&rdquo; means (1) Licensed Products not sold but delivered by Licensee to others (including deliveries for export), regardless of the basis of compensation, if any; (2) Licensed Products put into use by Licensee for any purpose other than routine testing of such Products; and (3) Licensed Products not sold as such but sold by Licensee as components or constituents of other products.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01I"></a>Form 12.01I&mdash;Royalty on Components Not Sold Separately</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Where Licensed Products are not sold separately, but are sold in combination with or as parts of other products, the Net Selling Price of the Licensed Products so sold will be calculated for the purpose of computing royalties due by applying to the total Net Selling Price (as herein defined) of the combined or composite products a fractional multiplier having as its denominator the total manufacturing cost of the combined or composite products (determined in accordance with Licensee&rsquo;s customary accounting procedures) and as its numerator the manufacturing cost of the included Licensed Products (similarly determined).</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01J"></a>Form 12.01J&mdash;Royalty Stacking Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If, after the Effective Date, Licensee is required to enter into a royalty-bearing license under intellectual property rights owned by a third party in order to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import Licensed Products in the Licensed Territory, Licensee may deduct from royalties due under this Agreement on such Licensed Products fifty percent (50%) of royalties actually paid by Licensee to such third party, but in no event will the royalties paid to Licensor under this Agreement be less than fifty percent (50%) of the amount due pursuant to Article ___ hereof. This provision will apply only to prospective running royalties payable to third parties on the same basis as required by Article ___ hereof, and no credit will be allowed for lump-sum license fees, for milestone payments, for minimum annual royalties in excess of accrued royalties, for any amounts paid for past infringement of any third party&rsquo;s rights or for any amount paid for rights not required to permit Licensee to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Licensed Products as provided in this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 12.02A&mdash;Royalty Obligation&mdash;Sold or Otherwise Disposed Of</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee will pay Licensor royalties at the rate(s) specified in Article ___ of this Agreement on all Licensed Products sold or otherwise disposed of under any subsisting and unexpired claim of any Licensed Patent.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 12.02B&mdash;Royalty Obligation&mdash;Different Countries of Manufacture and Sale</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee will pay Licensor royalties at the rate(s) specified in Article ___ of this Agreement on all Royalty-Base Products manufactured, sold, or otherwise disposed of under any subsisting and unexpired claim of any Licensed Patent. Only one royalty will be payable on each Royalty-Base Product despite the existence of Licensed Patents in the countries of manufacture and sale.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02C"></a>Form 12.02C&mdash;Royalty Obligation&mdash;Process of Manufacture</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee will pay Licensor royalties at the rate(s) specified in Article ___ of this Agreement on all Royalty-Base Products produced by use of an invention claimed in any Licensed Patent that is unexpired at the date of such use.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02D"></a>Form 12.02D&mdash;Royalty Obligation&mdash;Product of Licensed Process Made and Sold</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee will pay Licensor royalties at the rate(s) specified in Article ___ of this Agreement on all Royalty-Base Products that are (i) produced by use of an invention claimed in any Licensed Patent that is unexpired at the date of such use and (ii) sold or otherwise disposed of by Licensee at any time.</p>



<p class="h3"><a name="03A"></a>Form 12.03A&mdash;Reporting Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee agrees to make written reports to Licensor quarterly within thirty (30) days after the first days of each January, April, July, and October during the life of the Agreement and as of such dates, stating in each such report the number, description, and aggregate Net Selling Prices of each Royalty-Base Product sold or otherwise disposed of during the preceding three (3) calendar months and on which royalty is payable as provided in Article ___ hereof. The first such report will include all such Royalty-Base Products sold or otherwise disposed of prior to the date of such report [or &ldquo;between the Effective Date of this Agreement and the date of such report,&rdquo; if that is the agreed arrangement]. Concurrently with the making of each such report, Licensee will pay to Licensor royalties at the rate specified in Article ___ of this Agreement on the Royalty-Base Products included therein.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="03B"></a>Form 12.03B&mdash;Post-Termination Report</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee also agrees to make a written report to the Licensor within thirty (30) days after the date of any termination or expiration of this agreement, stating in such report the number, description, and Net Selling Prices of all Royalty-Base Products that were sold or otherwise disposed of and on which royalty is payable hereunder but that were not previously reported to Licensor.</p>
<p class="h3"><a name="03C"></a>Form 12.03C&mdash;Royalty Obligation and Termination</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The obligation to pay royalties will terminate as to each of the Licensed Patents on expiration of the Licensed Patent, except that royalties accrued but not paid prior to such expiration will be payable with the next report made under the provisions of this Article. A patent will be deemed to expire at midnight of the day of expiration.</p>
<p class="h3"><a name="03D"></a>Form 12.03D&mdash;Royalty Accrual</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Under this Agreement, Licensed Products will be considered sold when shipped or when an invoice is sent out, whichever occurs first, except that upon expiration of any Licensed Patent covering such Licensed Product, or upon any termination or expiration of the license granted herein, all Licensed Products Licensee made by, on, or prior to the date of such expiration or termination that have not been shipped or invoiced prior thereto will be subject to royalty and reported to Licensor in the Post Termination Report called for by paragraph ___. Royalties paid on Licensed Products that are not accepted by the customer may be credited by Licensee against subsequent royalties payable.</p>
<p class="h3"><a name="03E"></a>Form 12.03E&mdash;Alternative Royalty Accrual</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The obligation to make payments for Licensed Products as required by this Agreement will accrue at the time such products are manufactured or produced. Inventory or stocks of such products existing as of expiration or termination of this Agreement but sold thereafter will require payment to Licensor under the terms of this Agreement upon such sale. Licensee will remit payment and report as required in Article __ after such sales until such inventory or stocks are exhausted. Licensor will have the right to audit Licensee&rsquo;s records as provided in Section __ within ninety (90) days after Licensee reports the final sale of such inventory or stocks.</p>
<p class="h3"><a name="03F"></a>Form 12.03F&mdash;Late Payments</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any amounts not paid by Licensee when due under this Agreement will be subject to interest from and including the date payment is due through and including the date upon which Licensee makes a wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account designated by Licensor at a rate equal to the sum of three percent (3%) plus the annual prime rate or successive annual prime rates of interest quoted in the Money Rates section of the on-line edition of the Wall Street Journal (at <a href="http://www.interactive.wsj.com" target="_blank">http://www.interactive.wsj.com</a>) calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="04A"></a>Form 12.04A&mdash;Minimum Royalty Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In case the royalties paid do not aggregate a minimum of ____ dollars ($______) for the year ending December 31, 20__, and for each succeeding calendar year during the life of this agreement, Licensee, in order to retain the license granted herein, will pay to Licensor, within thirty (30) days of the end of such year, the difference between the royalties actually paid under this Agreement for such year and such minimum sum.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="04B"></a>Form 12.04B&mdash;Minimum Royalty Provision (Alternate)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In case royalties paid do not aggregate a minimum of ____ dollars ($______) for the year ending December 31, 20__, and the same amount for each succeeding calendar year during the continuance of this Agreement, Licensor may at its option terminate this Agreement and the license granted to Licensee by thirty (30) days&rsquo; notice in writing to Licensee, served on Licensee within thirty (30) days after receipt of the last report for such calendar year, unless Licensee, within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice, pays Licensor such additional sum as may be necessary to bring the payment for such calendar year up to the specified minimum.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="05A"></a>Form 12.05A&mdash;Records and Audits</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee agrees to keep records showing the sales or other disposition of Licensed Products sold or otherwise disposed of under the license herein granted in sufficient detail to enable the royalties payable hereunder by Licensee to be determined, and further agrees to permit its books and records to be examined from time to time to the extent necessary to verify the reports provided for in Article ___, such examination to be made at the expense of Licensor by any auditor appointed by Licensor who is reasonably acceptable to Licensee, or, at the option and expense of Licensee, by a certified public accountant appointed by Licensee.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="05B"></a>Form 12.05B&mdash;Records and Audits With Time Limit</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee agrees to keep true and accurate records, files, and books of account containing all the data reasonably required for the full computation and verification of the royalties to be paid and the information to be given in the reports provided for in Article ___ hereof, and Licensee further agrees to permit its books and records to be examined from time to time to the extent necessary to verify such reports, such examination to be made at the expense of Licensor by any auditor appointed by Licensor and reasonably acceptable to Licensee, or by a certified public accountant appointed by Licensor; provided that only those royalties paid by Licensee to Licensor within the two (2) year period immediately preceding the start of the audit, and their supporting records, files, and books of account will be subject to audit.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="05C"></a>Form 12.05C&mdash;Audit of Competitor&rsquo;s Records</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee agrees to keep records showing the sales of devices sold under the license herein granted in sufficient detail to enable the royalties payable hereunder by Licensee to be determined, and further agrees to permit its books and records to be examined from time to time to the extent necessary to verify the reports provided for in Article ___, such examination to be made at the expense of Licensor by an independent auditor appointed by Licensor who will report to Licensor only the amount of royalty payable for the period under audit.</p>
<p class="h3"><a name="05D"></a>Form 12.05D&mdash;Audit of Competitor&rsquo;s Records (Alternate)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee agrees to keep or cause to be kept such records as are required to determine, in a manner consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles then in effect, the accuracy of calculations of all sums or credits due under this Agreement. Such records must be retained for no less than a four (4) year period following the year in which any payments were made hereunder. Once per calendar year, Licensor may engage, at its own expense, an independent certified public accountant appointed by Licensor and reasonably acceptable to Licensee, to examine, in confidence, the records of Licensee as may be necessary to determine, with respect to any calendar year, the correctness or completeness of any report or payment required to be made under this Agreement. The report of such accountant will be limited to a certificate verifying the correctness of any report made or payment submitted by Licensee during such period, but the report may include, in the event the accountant is unable to verify the correctness of any such payment, information relating to why such payment is unverifiable. All information contained in any such certificate will be deemed Confidential Information, subject to the obligations set forth in Article ___  of this Agreement. If any audit performed under this Section ___ discloses a variance of more than five percent (5%) from the amount of the original report, royalty, or payment calculation, Licensee will reimburse Licensor for the full cost of the performance of such audit, but in no event more than $________.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="06A"></a>Form 12.06A&mdash;Inflation Adjustment Clause</p>
<p class="ddw12">The royalties payable are to depend on the purchasing power of the dollar, as reflected by the Monthly All-Commodity Index of Wholesale Prices (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Index&rdquo;), issued by the U.S. Government (at present through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics). In order to stabilize the purchasing power of such royalties, they will be subject to adjustment in each calendar year<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1933-1" id="footnote-1933-1-backlink" name="footnote-1933-1-backlink">[1]</a> period covered by this license in the following manner, in accordance with any major fluctuations in the Index:</p>
<p class="ddw12">If the Index published for December of any calendar year during the term of this Agreement is more than <em>x</em> or less than <em>y</em>, then the royalties payable for the immediately following calendar year will be the royalties calculated as provided in Article ___, plus the same percent of such royalties as the percent by which the point value of the Index published for the preceding December is more than <em>x</em>, or minus the same percent of such royalties as the percent by which the point value of the Index published for the preceding December is less than <em>y</em>, as the case may be.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="06B"></a>Form 12.06B&mdash;Alternate Inflation Adjustment Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The royalty rate specified in Article ___ hereof will be adjusted for each calendar year to reflect the percentage change in the ________ (&ldquo;Index&rdquo;) in accordance with the following formula:</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter"><img src="images/royalty-rate-formula.png" width="200" height="46" alt="Form 12.06B Royalty Rate Formula"></p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">where</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">NRR is the new royalty rate to be effective on January 1 of the calendar year;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">BI is the Index published for the December immediately preceding the Effective Date of this Agreement;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">NI is the Index published for December immediately preceding the calendar year; and</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">IRR is the initial royalty rate applied as of the Effective Date of this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="07"></a>Form 12.07&mdash;Licensee Nomenclature Provision</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee agrees to inform Licensor promptly after the execution of this Agreement as to the specific nomenclature and type designations under which Licensee will render invoices covering sales of Licensed Products, and further agrees to inform Licensor of any change or new designations that may thereafter be made or adopted for such devices, and Licensee, in rendering invoices for Licensed Products sold under the license herein granted, agrees that it will in such invoices invariably use the nomenclature and type designation so furnished to Licensor.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1933-1-backlink" id="footnote-1933-1" name="footnote-1933-1">1</a>] This period may correspond to the royalty payment and report period in the license agreement (i.e., quarterly, semiannual, or annual), but selecting the shorter periods imposes burdens and opportunities for error that would be unnecessary in times of relatively little change in inflation. Since some indices are generated only annually, the preferable adjustment period would be annual.</p>
