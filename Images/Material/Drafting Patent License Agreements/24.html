<div class="ddw18">Chapter 24: Validity and Construction of Patents</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 24.00A&mdash;Conditional No Challenge Clause</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">To the extent legally enforceable, Licensee hereby agrees, so long as this Agreement is in effect, not to file any action that challenges the validity, enforceability, or patentability of any Licensed Patent.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 24.00B&mdash;Procedural Ground Rules for a Validity Challenge by the Licensee</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">1. Nothing in this Agreement precludes Licensee from contesting the validity of any Licensed Patent. In the event evidentiary material comes to the attention of Licensee subsequent to Licensee&rsquo;s execution of this Agreement that, in the judgment of Licensee, bears on the validity or scope of any Licensed Patent, Licensor will in good faith discuss with Licensee whether such evidentiary material so affects the validity or scope of the Licensed Patent to which it is asserted to apply that the terms of the license in respect to such Licensed Patent should be modified.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">2. Licensee may prospectively terminate this Agreement as a whole or its license and concomitant future obligations in respect to any Licensed Patent upon thirty (30) days written notice to Licensor. Assertion by Licensee, subsequent to the date of its execution of this Agreement, of the invalidity or unenforceability of any claim of any Licensed Patent in a Declaratory Judgment Action or in any proceeding before an administrative body including, but not limited to, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may, at the option of Licensor, be conclusively presumed to constitute Licensee&rsquo;s termination, as of the filing date of the Declaratory Judgment Action or proceeding, of its license in respect to such claim and of its obligation under this Agreement for payment of royalties in respect to Licensee&rsquo;s future operations under the claim (but not under any other claim).</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 24.00C&mdash;Disclosure of Basis for Invalidity of Licensed Patent</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In the event Licensee intends to assert in any forum that any Licensed Patent is invalid, unenforceable, or unpatentable, Licensee will, not less than ninety (90) days prior to making any such assertion, provide to Licensor a complete written disclosure of each and every basis then known to Licensee for such assertion and, with such disclosure, will provide Licensor with a copy of any document or publication upon which Licensee intends to rely in support of such assertion. Licensee&rsquo;s failure to comply with this provision will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 24.00D&mdash;Effect of Judgment Dealing With Patent Validity or Scope</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If, in any judicial, administrative, or arbitration proceeding in which the validity, infringement, or priority of invention of any claim of any Licensed Patent is in issue, a judgment, decree, or award is entered that becomes not further reviewable through the exhaustion of all permissible applications for rehearing or review by a superior tribunal, or through the expiration of the time permitted for such applications (hereinafter referred to as an &ldquo;irrevocable judgment&rdquo;), the construction placed on any such claim by such irrevocable judgment will thereafter be followed, not only as to such claim but as to all claims to which such construction applies, with respect to acts occurring or payments made thereafter; and, if such irrevocable judgment holds any claim invalid or is adverse to the patent as to inventorship, Licensee will be relieved thereafter from including in its reports apparatus sold thereafter covered only by such claim or by any broader claim to which such irrevocable judgment is applicable, and from the performance of those other acts that may be required by this Agreement only because of any such claim.</p>
