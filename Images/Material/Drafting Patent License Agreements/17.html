<div class="ddw18">Chapter 17: Indemnification and Liability Insurance</div>

<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 17.00A&mdash;Mutual Indemnity for Collaboration</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">ABC agrees to defend, indemnify and hold XYZ and its Affiliates and all of their directors, officers, personnel, and their successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all expenses, damages, losses, costs, and liabilities (including, but not limited to, attorneys&rsquo; fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to the willful or negligent acts or omissions on the part of ABC or its employees, including, but not limited to, injury or death to all persons (including employees and agents of XYZ or its Affiliates) as well as damage to any property, except as may result solely from the willful or negligent acts of XYZ or its employees.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">XYZ agrees to defend, indemnify and hold ABC and its Affiliates and all of their directors, officers, personnel, and their successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all expenses, damages, losses, costs, and liabilities (including, but not limited to, attorneys&rsquo; fees and court costs) arising out of or relating to the willful or negligent acts or omissions on the part of XYZ or its employees, including, but not limited to, injury or death to all persons (including employees and agents of ABC or its Affiliates) as well as damage to any property, except as may result solely from the willful or negligent acts of ABC or its employees.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 17.00B&mdash;Defend Obligation</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Seller expressly acknowledges and agrees to undertake the defense of any such Third Party Claim brought against Buyer, provided that Seller is notified of the proceeding within a reasonable timeframe. Buyer will provide any reasonably requested assistance to resolve any Third Party Claim, and Seller will reimburse any necessary and reasonable expenses incurred by Buyer in providing such assistance within fifteen (15) days of receiving a receipt-supported invoice for said expenses. Any settlement intended to bind Buyer will not be final without Buyer&rsquo;s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. If Seller fails to undertake the defense as provided for above, then Buyer may do so as Buyer deems appropriate, and the reasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorney&rsquo;s fees thereof, will be reimbursed by Seller. Nothing herein will prevent Buyer from defending any Third Party Claim at its own expense through its own counsel at its own risk.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 17.00C&mdash;Defend Obligation Alternate</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Seller will have the right to control the defense of all Claims, but only to the extent the Claims involve Products supplied by Seller. Seller will have the right to select counsel to defend all Claims. If Buyer reasonably, determines that the counsel selected and provided by Seller to defend Buyer is unacceptable or that a conflict of interest exists between Buyer and Seller-selected counsel, Buyer may request Seller to replace the counsel at Seller&rsquo;s expense. Seller will not have the right to select counsel for the defense of any claim not involving Seller-supplied Products. Buyer, at all times, may retain its own counsel at its own expense. Seller may settle the Claim, provided, however, Seller must obtain Buyer&rsquo;s prior approval of any settlement that would adversely affect any interest of Buyer.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 17.00D&mdash;Control of Settlement by Indemnitor</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Seller, in the defense of any Claim, will not, except with the written consent of Buyer, consent to entry of any order, preliminary injunction, or judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include, as an unconditional term, a grant by the third party claimant to Buyer, its officers, directors, employees, agents and direct and indirect customers of a release from all liability and blame with respect to the Claim or the litigation. Buyer will have the right at all times to accept or reject any offer to settle any Claim or litigation against it.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00E"></a>Form 17.00E&mdash;Consequential Damage Disclaimer</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Except in connection with a Party&rsquo;s willful and intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud, in no event will either Party or its Affiliates, under any circumstances, be liable or obligated in any manner to the other Party or its Affiliates for any special, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages or loss of profits arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, even if such Party or its Affiliate is informed in advance of the possibility of such damages occurring and regardless of whether or not the damages were foreseeable and regardless of the theory or cause of action upon which any damages might be based. This limitation is separate and independent of any other remedy limitations and will not fail if such other limitation fails. The foregoing will not be deemed to modify or limit the obligations of either Party to indemnify the other Party for any Third Party Actions pursuant to Article ___.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00F"></a>Form 17.00F&mdash;Mutual Indemnity in License Agreement</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor will hold harmless, defend and indemnify Licensee and its Affiliates from and against (and shall reimburse Licensee and its Affiliates for) any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) (collectively, &ldquo;Losses&rdquo;) suffered or incurred by any of Licensee and its Affiliates in any third party action, suit, litigation or arbitration (&ldquo;Third Party Action&rdquo;) resulting from any (a) material breach by Licensor of this Agreement or (b) gross negligence or willful misconduct of Licensor or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents in connection with this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee will hold harmless, defend and indemnify Licensor and its Affiliates from and against (and shall reimburse Licensor and its Affiliates for) any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of Licensor and its Affiliates in any Third Party Action resulting from: (a) any material breach of this Agreement by Licensee, its Affiliates or any Sublicensee; (b) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of Licensee, its Affiliates, any Sublicensee or any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents in connection with this Agreement or any sublicense; and (c) exercise of rights and the licenses granted hereunder by Licensee, its Affiliates or Sublicensees (including the commercialization of any Licensed Products or any other exploitation of any Licensed IP by or on behalf of Licensee, its Affiliates or any Sublicensee).</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00G"></a>Form 17.00G&mdash;Infringement Indemnity</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Seller agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless, Buyer, and Buyer&rsquo;s Affiliates and all of their customers and dealers, and all of their directors, officers, personnel and all of their successors, and assigns, from any and all expenses, damages, awards, claims, actions, demands, losses, liabilities and causes of action (including, but not limited to, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses) arising out of or related to infringement or an alleged infringement of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or trademark for or on account of using and/or commercializing Products furnished by Seller to Buyer hereunder; provided, however, Seller will have no obligation if Seller&rsquo;s compliance with specifications prescribed by and originating with Buyer constitutes the sole basis for the infringement or the alleged infringement. Seller, at its sole expense, will control defense and settlement of all suits or proceedings as described in this section. No settlement that prevents Buyer from continuing to use or commercialize the Products as provided herein, in whole or in part, is to be made without Buyer&rsquo;s prior written consent. Buyer will give Seller prompt written notice of any such claim of which it is formally notified. The failure of Buyer to provide Seller with prompt notice does not relieve Seller of its obligations under this Section unless such failure to promptly notify Seller causes irreparable harm. In all events, Seller, and any party against whom suit is brought, has the right to participate in the defense of any such suit or proceeding through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense. If using or commercializing Products furnished hereunder is enjoined as a result of such suit, Seller, at no expense to Buyer, will obtain for Buyer and its Affiliates the right to use and re-sell the Products or will substitute equivalent products acceptable to Buyer and extend this indemnity thereto.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00H"></a>Form 17.00H&mdash;Infringement Indemnity: Limited Liability</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">1. If a patent owner sues the Buyer alleging that the Product as sold by the Seller or the Buyer&rsquo;s use of the Product infringes the claims of the patent and if the Buyer gives prompt notice of the suit to the Seller, the Seller will defend the suit, provided the Buyer gives the Seller continuous cooperation in the defense of the suit.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">2. In any suit the Seller defends under paragraph 1, the Seller may control the defense, will pay all litigation costs including attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred by the Seller, and will indemnify the Buyer for all damages awarded by a court or any settlement payments approved by the Seller, subject to the limitation in paragraph 4.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">3. In any suit the Seller defends under paragraph 1, if the Buyer is enjoined by final, unappealable court order or by settlement approved by the Seller from using the Product as sold by the Seller, the Seller, at its option, may (a) procure for the Buyer the right to continue using the Product, (b) replace or modify the Product to avoid infringement, or (c) repossess the Product in exchange for a refund of the depreciated value of the Product. The Seller&rsquo;s option selected under this paragraph is the Buyer&rsquo;s sole remedy against the Seller for any prospective effects of any court order or settlement enjoining the Buyer&rsquo;s use of the Product.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">4. The Seller&rsquo;s total, cumulative liability under paragraphs 2 and 3 is limited to 100% of the price paid to the Seller by the Buyer for the Product.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the Seller is not obligated to defend and will not be liable for costs or damages awarded in any suit for infringement in which (a) the Product was made by the Seller according to specifications supplied by the Buyer, (b) the alleged infringement is based on use by the Buyer, without Seller&rsquo;s permission, of the Product as sold by the Seller in combination with another item not sold by the Seller, where the alleged infringement arises from the combination or from the practice of a method made possible by the combination, or (c) the alleged infringement is based on the Product as modified by the Buyer without the Seller&rsquo;s permission.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00I"></a>Form 17.00I&mdash;Indemnity Cap</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The seller&rsquo;s total cumulative liability for settlement payments and damages finally awarded with respect to any patent infringement claim, where such payments or damages are based in any way on the buyer&rsquo;s revenue from the use or permitted resale of the seller&rsquo;s products, will be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) The seller must pay an amount equaling the purchase price of the product sold under this contract; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) The seller and the buyer will apportion liability for any remaining balance of settlement payments and damages awarded with respect to any patent infringement claim, the apportionment being based on the ratio of the gross revenues obtained by the seller from the sale of the product to buyer under this contract to the gross revenues obtained by the buyer from the use or permitted resale of such product.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00J"></a>Form 17.00J&mdash;Limiting Liability</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If the Product is subject to a Claim or, if in Seller&rsquo;s judgment, likely to become subject to a Claim, at Sellers&rsquo;s sole discretion, Seller may: (a) obtain a license to continue the use or to sell the Product purchased from Seller; (b) refund the purchase price paid to Seller for such, less a reasonable amount for use, damage, or obsolescence, and remove such Product from Buyer&rsquo;s possession, and/or terminate Buyer&rsquo;s license to use or sell such Product; or (c) replace or modify the Product so as to be substantially functionally equivalent but non-infringing.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01"></a>Form 17.01&mdash;Indemnification by Licensor</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. Licensor will assume the defense of any suit brought against Licensee or its vendees, mediate or immediate, for infringement of any U.S. patent<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-1" id="footnote-1931-1-backlink" name="footnote-1931-1-backlink">[1]</a> or for wrongful use of proprietary information of any third party insofar as such suit is based on a claim that the infringement or wrongful use is attributable to Licensee&rsquo;s application without substantial modification of Technical Information supplied under this Agreement. In any such suit, Licensor will indemnify Licensee against any money damages or costs awarded in such suit in respect to such a claim.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. The obligations of Licensor stated in paragraph 1, above, apply only if (a) Licensee promptly informs Licensor in writing of any claim within the scope of paragraph 1, (b) Licensor is given exclusive control of the defense of such claim and all negotiations relating to settlement and, (c) Licensee assists Licensor in all necessary respects in conduct of the suit.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. Licensor&rsquo;s total liability to incur out-of-pocket costs in the defense of any suit or suits and to pay damages awarded in any suit or suits is limited to the amount theretofore paid to Licensor by Licensee under this Agreement,<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-2" id="footnote-1931-2-backlink" name="footnote-1931-2-backlink">[2]</a> and Licensee will advance to Licensor any amounts required to be expended by Licensor in excess of that limit. Amounts so advanced shall be credited to future payments due from Licensee to Licensor as a result of Licensee&rsquo;s operations under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">4. The foregoing paragraphs of this Article ___ state the entire liability of Licensor to Licensee in respect to Licensee&rsquo;s use of Technical Information, and, except as specifically provided in those paragraphs, Licensor will not be liable either directly or as an indemnitor of Licensee because of any claim arising in any way from licensee&rsquo;s use of Technical Information.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 17.02A&mdash;Indemnification by Licensee</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee will hold Licensor harmless against all liabilities, demands, damages, expenses, or losses arising (1) out of use by Licensee or its transferees of inventions licensed or information furnished under this Agreement or (2) out of any use, sale, or other disposition by Licensee or its transferees of products made by use of such inventions or information.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 17.02B&mdash;Trademark Disclaimer</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee has no right to and hereby agrees not to use in any manner the name, trade name, or any trademark of Licensor.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03"></a>Form 17.03&mdash;Mutual Indemnity</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"><strong>By ABC</strong>. ABC will indemnify and hold harmless XYZ, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (&ldquo;<strong>XYZ Indemnitees</strong>&rdquo;) from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Liabilities</strong>&rdquo;), incurred as a result of any claims, demands, actions, or other proceedings by any Third Party to the extent resulting from: (a) the material breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant by ABC under this Agreement; (b) the use by ABC of any Technology of XYZ or Confidential Information of XYZ provided hereunder; or (c) the negligence or willful misconduct of ABC. The obligation to indemnify pursuant to subsection (a) will expire three (3) years after expiration or termination of this Agreement. The indemnity obligations pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) will continue so long as a cause of action giving rise to the right of indemnification may be brought against the XYZ Indemnitees.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"><strong>By XYZ</strong>. XYZ will indemnify and hold harmless ABC, its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (&ldquo;<strong>ABC Indemnitees</strong>&rdquo;) (for purposes of this Article ___, the term &ldquo;Indemnitee&rdquo; may refer to either or both the XYZ Indemnitees and the ABC Indemnitees, as the context may indicate) from and against all Liabilities, incurred as a result of any claims, demands, actions, or other proceedings by any Third Party to the extent resulting from: (a) the material breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant by XYZ under this Agreement; (b) the use by XYZ of any Technology of ABC or Confidential Information of ABC provided hereunder; or (c) the negligence or willful misconduct of XYZ. The obligation to indemnify pursuant to subsection (a) will expire three (3) years after expiration or termination of this Agreement. The indemnity obligations pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) will continue so long as a cause of action giving rise to the right of indemnification may be brought by the ABC Indemnitees.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"><strong>Procedure</strong>. If a Party or Indemnitee intends to claim indemnification under this Article ___, it will promptly notify the other Party (the &ldquo;<strong>Indemnitor</strong>&rdquo;) in writing of any claim, demand, action, or other proceeding for which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification, and the Indemnitor may participate in, and, to the extent the Indemnitor so desires, assume the defense of such claim, demand, action, or proceeding with counsel mutually satisfactory to the Parties; provided, however, that an Indemnitee will have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnitor, if representation of such Indemnitee by the counsel retained by the Indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between the Indemnitee and any other Party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The obligations of this Article ___ will not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, demand, action, or other proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, will relieve the Indemnitor of any obligation to the Indemnitee under this Article ___. The Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any claim, demand, action, or other proceeding covered by this Article ___.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="04A"></a>Form 17.04A&mdash;Licensee to Obtain Insurance</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee agrees to obtain and maintain in effect for the term of this agreement plus five years, general liability insurance extending to bodily injury and property damage, with limits of ______ per claim with no annual aggregate limit, and to products liability with limits of ____________ per claim with no annual aggregate limit. Licensee will provide Licensor with a copy of such insurance policies and any binders promptly after execution of this Agreement. Licensee will also promptly provide Licensor with a copy of any amendments or modifications of the insurance policies.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="04B"></a>Form 17.04B&mdash;Licensee to Obtain Insurance (Alternative)</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">During the term of this Agreement and so long as Licensed Products are being sold or used, Licensee will maintain comprehensive general liability, property damage, and product liability insurance, through insurance carriers with an A.M. Best Rating of A-VII or better. Such insurance coverage will be maintained with policy limits to reasonably cover the obligations and the scope of activities contemplated herein, and will name Licensor as an additional insured. Licensee will, at the reasonable request of Licensor, provide Licensor with evidence of such insurance coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and only upon written notice to Licensor of its agreement to provide protection of the scope contemplated by this Section ___, Licensee may self-insure against each risk identified in this Section ___ in amounts not less than the amounts identified as appropriate hereunder.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-1-backlink" id="footnote-1931-1" name="footnote-1931-1">1</a>] Even in a worldwide license, good practice suggests limiting liability to infringement of patents that the licensor can readily evaluate. Obviously, such a limitation will be subject to negotiation.
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1931-2-backlink" id="footnote-1931-2" name="footnote-1931-2">2</a>] For reasons previously discussed in this chapter, a limit on a licensor&rsquo;s potential liability is appropriate to avoid entering into a license where the licensor has the chance of losing more than it gains. The limit can be up to the amount, or some fraction thereof, the licensor receives under the agreement.
