<div class="ddw18">Chapter 18: Licensing of Pending Patent Applications</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 18.00A&mdash;Royalties Under Pending Patent Application&mdash;Alternative 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">1. With respect to pending patent applications that are part of Licensed Patents, for a period of two (2) years from the date of this agreement, Licensee will pay royalties at the rates specified in Section ___ on all Licensed Products, as herein defined, that are sold or otherwise disposed of by it within that period.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">2. Licensee will continue to pay such royalties after the end of such two (2) years on Licensed Products the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, import or other disposition of by Licensee would infringe an issued claim of a patent in the Licensed Patents or an allowed claim of a patent application in the Licensed Patents as if at the time such claim were issued.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">3. If, at the end of two (2) years from the date of this agreement, there is no issued claim of a Licensed Patent, and no allowed claim of a Licensed Patent that if issued, would be infringed by the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, import or other disposition by Licensee of a product, Licensee may discontinue payment of royalties until a claim or claims of a Licensed Patent is issued and, or allowed and if issued, would be infringed by the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, import or other disposition by Licensee of a Licensed Product.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 18.00B&mdash;Royalties Under Pending Patent Application&mdash;Alternative 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The royalties provided for in Section ___ will be paid by Licensee in respect to its products utilizing any invention or inventions disclosed and claimed in the enumerated patent applications; provided, however, that if no Letters Patent are granted claiming such invention within three (3) years after the date of this Agreement, royalty payments will be discontinued until such date as any such Letters Patent are granted. On any such date, payment of royalties will be resumed in respect to products of Licensee claimed in such Letters Patent.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 18.00C&mdash;Royalties Under Pending Patent Application&mdash;Alternative 3</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The royalties provided for in Section ___ will be paid by Licensee in respect to its products covered by any pending claim of the enumerated patent applications; provided, however, that if no claim covering Licensee&rsquo;s products is allowed within two (2) years after the Effective Date, royalties, after such two (2) years, will be accrued but not paid until such time as Letters Patent containing such a claim issue to Licensor. If such Letters Patent issue within two (2) years after the date such accrual began, the accrued royalties will be paid to Licensor. If no such Letters Patent issue within the two (2) year period specified in the preceding sentence, the accrued royalties will be retained by Licensee, and royalties thereafter will be paid only in respect to products of Licensee that, when made, used, sold, offered for sale, imported, or otherwise disposed of, are covered by claims of issued Letters Patent of Licensor that are licensed to Licensee under this Agreement.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 18.00D&mdash;Royalties Under Pending Patent Application&mdash;Alternative 4</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The royalties provided for in Section ___ will be paid by Licensee in respect to its products covered by any pending claim of the enumerated patent applications; provided, however, that if Letters Patent do not issue within three years after the Effective Date with a claim or claims covering Licensee&rsquo;s products, and none of the enumerated applications (or continuations or divisions of them) pending at the end of the three years contains an allowed claim having such coverage, Licensee may thereafter, at its option, terminate this agreement by giving thirty (30) days&rsquo; notice to that effect to Licensor.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 18.01A&mdash;Filing and Prosecution of Applications in University License</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">University is solely responsible for preparing, filing, prosecuting (including without limitation defense of the applications in an interference proceeding, reexamination, post-grant administrative proceeding or associated litigation), and maintaining the Patent Rights. University will not seek to substantially narrow the scope of or irrevocably abandon a pending application or an issued patent without obtaining Company&rsquo;s consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. University will keep Company fully informed of all actions taken in filing, prosecution, issuance, and maintenance of Patent Rights and will advise Company before taking any substantive actions in prosecuting the claims of any Patent Right sufficiently in advance to permit Company to comment, and University, absent good faith justification to the contrary, will adopt and employ such comments. University will use reasonable efforts to advance the prosecution of pending applications and avoid unreasonable delays in the prosecution of pending applications.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">University may file patent applications for Patent Rights in any non-U.S. territory. With respect to any non-U.S. territory in which it proposes to file a patent application, University will notify Company ninety (90) days before the applicable national phase filing deadline. Subject to Company&rsquo;s compliance with the following paragraph, University will file and prosecute a patent application in any country in which Company, by written notice, requests such filing; provided, however, that: (i) the written notice is received at least sixty (60) days before the applicable national phase filing deadline; and (ii) Company is not in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement as of the date written notice is received by University.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Company will reimburse University for all Patent Expenses incurred during the Term. Company will pay each undisputed invoice for Patent Expenses in full to University within thirty (30) days after the date of invoice. Upon at least sixty (60) days prior to written notice to University, Company may elect to discontinue payment of Patent Expenses with respect to any patent or patent application in any country, and thereafter Company will have no rights under any such patent or patent application.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 18.01B&mdash;Filing and Prosecution of Applications</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. Licensor will, within thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement, disclose to Licensee all information in its possession pertaining to the Licensed Inventions that may be necessary or useful for the preparation and filing of patent applications for the protection of such Licensed Inventions. Licensor will, thereafter, from time to time, on request, supply such additional information as may be necessary or desirable to facilitate prosecution of such applications.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. Licensee will, on receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 1, above, accept liaison and financial responsibility for</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Preparation, by a patent lawyer in independent practice who will be nominated by licensee and approved by licensor, of a patent application or applications on patentable aspects of the licensed inventions;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Filing, upon execution by the inventor, of such application or applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. Prosecution by such lawyer of the application or applications to allowance or to the point of necessary appeal from a final rejection by an Examiner of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. Except as may be later separately agreed in writing, Licensee does not assume financial or other responsibility for</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. The filing or prosecution of any appeal from a final rejection by an Examiner of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of any patent application on a licensed invention; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. The conduct of any interference in which the application or applications may become involved.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">4. Licensee will cause the lawyer to promptly deliver to Licensor copies of</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Any applications filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as provided in paragraph 2, above;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Any papers received from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office pertaining to such applications; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. Any papers filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office pertaining to such applications.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">5. Licensor may at any time, by notice to Licensee given as provided in Article ___ of this Agreement, assume and continue, at Licensor&rsquo;s own expense, direction of the prosecution of any application filed as provided in paragraph 2, above. Upon receipt by Licensee of any such notice from Licensor, Licensee will be relieved of all further financial and other responsibility in respect to the application affected by the notice. Failure of Licensor to give notice as provided in this paragraph 5 will be conclusive evidence of the satisfactory discharge by Licensee of its responsibilities under this Article ___, and Licensor&rsquo;s sole remedy for dissatisfaction with Licensee&rsquo;s discharge of responsibilities will be by the timely giving of such notice.</p>
