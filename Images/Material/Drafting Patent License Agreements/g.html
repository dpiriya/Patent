<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT</p>
<p class="ddw12">THIS AGREEMENT, dated ___________, 20__, is between ABC Company, a Maryland corporation having a principal place of business at Baltimore, MD (hereafter ABC Company), and XYZ Company, a company having a place of business at ___________ (hereafter XYZ Company).</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS ABC Company owns certain Confidential Information, as defined herein, which may relate to the design, manufacture, or use of one or more products that ABC Company desires to purchase;</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS XYZ Company wishes to sell one or more of the products to ABC Company and desires to receive from ABC Company any Confidential Information that ABC Company deems necessary to permit XYZ Company to design, manufacture, or sell the products to ABC Company; and</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS ABC Company is willing to disclose to XYZ Company such necessary Confidential Information provided XYZ Company preserves the confidential nature of the information and uses it solely for purposes of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12">NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3513-1" id="footnote-3513-1-backlink" name="footnote-3513-1-backlink">[1]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo;<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3513-2" id="footnote-3513-2-backlink" name="footnote-3513-2-backlink">[2]</a> as used in this Agreement means all technical or business information disclosed by ABC Company to XYZ Company pursuant to this Agreement that is identified at the time of disclosure or within thirty (30) days thereafter as being confidential and proprietary to ABC Company. No information will be regarded as Confidential Information if XYZ Company can show by competent proof that such information</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">a. was, at the time of disclosure to XYZ Company, already known by XYZ Company, as shown by written records in the possession of XYZ Company;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">b. was at the time of disclosure, or subsequently became, through no fault of XYZ Company, known to the general public through publication or otherwise; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">c. was, subsequent to disclosure to XYZ Company, lawfully and independently received by XYZ Company from a third party who had the right to disclose it without restriction.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2a">Specific aspects or details of Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be within the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company merely because the Confidential Information is embraced by general disclosures in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company. In addition, any combination of Confidential Information shall not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company merely because individual elements thereof are in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ Company.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">2. ABC Company, at its discretion, may disclose to XYZ Company any Confidential Information that ABC Company, in its reasonable judgment, believes is sufficient to enable XYZ Company to design, manufacture, or sell products that ABC Company wishes to purchase. ABC Company also may cause such disclosures to be made to XYZ Company on behalf of ABC Company by third parties who are under obligations of confidentiality to ABC Company; such disclosures from third parties shall be deemed to be disclosures by ABC Company.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">3. In consideration of each and every disclosure of Confidential Information by ABC Company to XYZ Company, XYZ Company agrees</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">a. to treat as confidential and to preserve the confidentiality of all Confidential Information disclosed by ABC Company to XYZ Company;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">b. to use any and all Confidential Information solely in connection with the design, manufacture, or sale of products to ABC Company and for no other purpose;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">c. to make no disclosures of any Confidential Information to any party other than officers and employees of XYZ Company;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">d. to limit access to Confidential Information to those officers and employees of XYZ Company having a reasonable need for such information and being bound by a written obligation to XYZ Company to maintain such information confidential; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">e. to maintain in confidence any information regarding the nature or scope of any transaction between ABC Company and XYZ Company, except to the extent such information must be disclosed pursuant to law, and then only after notifying ABC Company of such requirement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2a">Any obligation imposed by this paragraph 3 may be waived in writing by ABC Company as to particular Confidential Information and to a particular use or disclosure. Any such waiver will have a one-time effect and will not apply to any subsequent situation regardless of its similarity.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">4. All Confidential Information will remain the property of ABC Company, and upon request of ABC Company, XYZ Company will promptly return to ABC Company all Confidential Information, or any part or reproduction thereof.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">5. The obligations of XYZ Company and each employee and officer of XYZ Company under this Agreement will expire five (5) years from the date of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">6. This Agreement is subject to the laws (excluding conflicts rules) of the State of Maryland.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">7. The terms and provisions of this Agreement will inure to the benefit of ABC Company&rsquo;s successors and assigns and will be binding on XYZ Company and XYZ Company&rsquo;s successors and assigns. This paragraph notwithstanding, XYZ Company may not disclose any Confidential Information to any successor or assign absent prior written consent of ABC Company.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="G2"></a>Form G2&mdash;Confidential Evaluation Agreement with Option Terms</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">INITIAL CONFIDENTIAL EVALUATION AGREEMENT<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3513-4" id="footnote-3513-4-backlink" name="footnote-3513-4-backlink">[4]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">This is an Agreement by and between ABC Engineering Company, a Michigan corporation, located at ___________ (hereafter &ldquo;ABC&rdquo;), and XYZ Corporation, a ___________ corporation, having a principal place of business at ___________ (hereafter &ldquo;XYZ&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, ABC has developed and owns proprietary technical and commercial information concerning the design, manufacture, operation, and commercial exploitation of a ___________ (&ldquo;System&rdquo;), the System comprising a ___________ unit (&ldquo;Primary Unit&rdquo;) and circuits connecting the Primary Unit to the space being treated (&ldquo;Secondary Unit&rdquo;). The proprietary information includes inventions, patent applications, trade secrets, know-how, and working prototypes and components thereof, all of which ABC considers to be confidential and proprietary;</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, XYZ is considering a license from ABC under proprietary information related to manufacture and commercial exploitation of the Primary Unit and components thereof (&ldquo;Technology&rdquo;), and, as a part of that consideration, XYZ desires the opportunity to evaluate the Technology and the System on a confidential basis;</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, ABC is willing to disclose the Technology to XYZ on a nonexclusive basis solely for an evaluation under terms and conditions that will permit XYZ initially to obtain an overview of the Technology sufficient for a decision on whether to seek a negotiated option for a license and a subsequent detailed review of the Technology while preserving to ABC the confidential, proprietary nature of the Technology; and</p>
<p class="ddw12">WHEREAS, while ABC may provide others with a similar initial disclosure under similar terms and conditions, ABC is willing to negotiate for and to grant an exclusive option for an exclusive license to manufacture and sell the Primary Unit.</p>
<p class="ddw12">NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. This Agreement shall be effective on the date of signature of the last party to sign (&ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">2. The Technology pertaining to the Primary Unit is regarded as confidential by ABC and is to be proffered to XYZ as such. All Technology disclosed by ABC will be received and held in confidence by XYZ, and XYZ will not disclose the Technology to anyone and will not use the Technology for any purpose whatsoever other than its evaluation pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">3. XYZ will designate in writing not more than three evaluators who may be employees of or consultants contractually retained by XYZ and who will be reasonably acceptable to ABC. Each evaluator will sign a copy of the acknowledgment in Attachment A hereto which will accompany the written designation by XYZ. ABC will make an initial disclosure of the Technology to the evaluators for the sole purpose of permitting them to reach an initial opinion of the commercial worth of the Technology and to make a recommendation to XYZ.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">4. The initial disclosure of the Technology will be made at ABC&rsquo;s facility during not more than a three-day period to be mutually agreed upon by the parties. ABC will disclose to the evaluators the details of the Primary Unit including design and manufacturing information, manufacturing and operation cost estimations, and other information necessary to permit them to make an initial recommendation to XYZ concerning the Technology. The content and scope of the initial disclosure will be consistent with that outlined in Attachment B hereto. XYZ recognizes that significant aspects of the Technology are likely to be disclosed orally and therefore agrees that all or any part of the initial disclosure may be videotaped by ABC. Neither the videotape nor any other documents disclosed during the initial disclosure may be removed from the ABC facility.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">5. Although this Agreement does not contemplate disclosure for evaluation of proprietary information regarding the Secondary Unit, the parties recognize that some such information may be disclosed inadvertently during performance under this Agreement. Accordingly, to the extent such information is disclosed and concurrently or later identified as such in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the information will be subject to this Agreement as if a part of the Technology.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">6. After the initial disclosure, the evaluators may disclose to XYZ their opinion and recommendation, but may not disclose details of the Technology.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">7. XYZ and the evaluators will use reasonable commercial efforts, including efforts fully commensurate with those employed by XYZ for the protection of its own trade secrets, to protect ABC&rsquo;s Technology disclosed to XYZ pursuant to this Agreement. XYZ and the evaluators will be separately and collectively responsible for maintaining the Technology in confidence.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">8. ABC agrees that the confidentiality and use provisions of this Agreement will not apply to any Technology</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">a. that appears in issued patents or printed publications in integrated form or that otherwise is or becomes generally known in the trade other than through the fault of XYZ;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">b. that XYZ can show by written records was in XYZ&rsquo;s possession prior to its disclosure by ABC; or</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">c. that XYZ can show by written records came into its possession, without covenants of secrecy, from another party who is under no confidentiality obligation to ABC.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2a">Specific aspects or details of the Technology will not be deemed to be published, generally known in the trade, or otherwise within the public domain, or to be in the possession of XYZ, merely because the aspects of the Technology are embraced by general disclosures in the public domain or in XYZ&rsquo;s possession. In addition, any combination of aspects of the Technology will not be considered in the public domain or in the possession of XYZ merely because individual elements thereof are in the public domain or in XYZ&rsquo;s possession unless the combination and its principles are in the public domain or in XYZ&rsquo;s possession. The burden of proving these exceptions to the confidentiality and use provisions of this Agreement resides with XYZ.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">9. In consideration for the opportunity of an initial confidential evaluation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, XYZ will pay to ABC on execution of this Agreement a fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000). The fee shall be nonrefundable but may be credited against the option fee contemplated by paragraph 12(f) of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">10. If, after consideration of the initial disclosure and recommendation of the evaluators, XYZ decides it is not interested in further evaluation or a license, this Agreement will terminate except that the provisions of paragraphs 2, 5, 7, and 8 hereof will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">11. If XYZ is sufficiently interested in the Technology and the System to justify further evaluation, XYZ will provide written notice thereof to ABC within fifteen (15) business days after the end of the disclosure period agreed upon pursuant to paragraph 4 hereof. ABC, on receipt of such notice, will negotiate in good faith with XYZ for a license agreement and an option therefor.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">12. The option subject to negotiation pursuant to paragraph 11 hereof will include at least the following provisions:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">a. Within thirty (30) days after execution of the option, ABC will furnish to XYZ the proprietary documentation and tangible items (including prototypes) necessary to permit XYZ to conduct a thorough evaluation of the design, manufacture, and operation of the System and of XYZ&rsquo;s interest in the license under the Technology. ABC will provide to XYZ, in duplicate, a complete inventory of all documentation and tangible items furnished (&ldquo;Inventory&rdquo;). XYZ, by written notation and dated signature on the Inventory, will acknowledge receipt of all items received and note those items not received, if any. If XYZ determines to continue its evaluation away from the ABC facility, XYZ will bear the cost and responsibility for shipment. No shipment of any material from the ABC facility may be made until ABC receives from XYZ a signed copy of the Inventory.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">b. Prototypes included within the Technology may be the property of the U.S. Government pursuant to Government funding agreements. Accordingly, during the evaluation, XYZ will not subject any prototype or component thereof to destructive testing.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">c. Each document, item, videotape, program, or other material provided by ABC to XYZ, if proprietary to ABC, will contain the following legend on each page thereof:</p>
<p class="blockquote">CONFIDENTIAL DATA. PROPRIETARY TO ABC ENGINEERING COMPANY. FURNISHED FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY. NOT TO BE COPIED OR DISCLOSED OR USED FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN EVALUATION.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">d. XYZ will restrict disclosure of the Technology to the minimum number of officers, employees, and outside consultants of XYZ required to enable XYZ to further appraise the value of the Technology and the System. Each such officer, employee, and outside consultant, before the disclosure takes place, will sign an acknowledgment in the form set forth in Attachment A.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">e. Confidentiality and nonuse provisions as set forth in paragraphs 2, 7, and 8 of this Agreement will be included in the option agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">f. XYZ will pay to ABC an option fee of $100,000, half payable on execution of the option agreement and half payable on signature by XYZ of the Inventory. The option fee will be nonrefundable, but XYZ may credit the option fee against the license fee required by the license agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">g. XYZ will have ninety (90) days after the date of signature on the Inventory in which to evaluate the Technology and the System. Exercise of the option for a license will be effective on receipt by ABC of the negotiated license executed by XYZ.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">h. If XYZ fails to exercise the option pursuant to its terms, XYZ, within ten (10) days after expiration of the option, will</p>
<p class="ddw12hang4">i. return all documents and tangible items it has received from ABC under the option agreement;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang4">ii. assume the liability for any damage to tangible items returned;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang4">iii. forward to ABC all copies, summaries, records, descriptions, modifications, drawings, photographs, videotapes, computer-based data, and adaptations of the documents and tangible items received from ABC and all other documents or items that contain any information derived from the documents and tangible items received from ABC;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang4">iv. irretrievably erase all computer memories containing any information received from ABC or derived from information received from ABC; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang4">v. not manufacture or sell any system comparable to the System for five (5) years after the effective date of the option agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">13. The license agreement will be consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in Attachment C hereto.</p>
<p class="ddw12">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement in duplicate originals.</p>

<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">RECITAL</p>
<p class="ddw12">ABC owns certain Confidential Information, as defined herein, which Confidant desires to receive solely for the Purpose as defined herein. ABC is willing to disclose to Confidant such Confidential Information for the Purpose, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">AGREEMENT</p>
<p class="ddw12">In consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. <strong>Definitions</strong>. As used in this agreement:</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-2-backlink" id="footnote-3513-2" name="footnote-3513-2">2</a>] See &sect;27.00 <em>supra</em> regarding definition of proprietary information.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-3-backlink" id="footnote-3513-3" name="footnote-3513-3">3</a>] See Chapter 6 <em>supra</em>.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-5-backlink" id="footnote-3513-5" name="footnote-3513-5">5</a>] A standard agreement for use by a company disclosing its information to a potential contractor, supplier, or partner.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-6-backlink" id="footnote-3513-6" name="footnote-3513-6">6</a>] Compare to Form G4. Both are drafted by ABC and both are more favorable to ABC, although neither is overreaching or unreasonable. In Form G3, ABC has the discretion of what to disclose. In Form G4 such a provision is missing.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-7-backlink" id="footnote-3513-7" name="footnote-3513-7">7</a>] A standard agreement for use by a company receiving information from a potential contractor, supplier, or partner.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-8-backlink" id="footnote-3513-8" name="footnote-3513-8">8</a>] ABC, the recipient, wishes to limit Confidential Information to that which is marked, whereas in Form G3, where ABC was disclosing the information, no marking was required.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-9-backlink" id="footnote-3513-9" name="footnote-3513-9">9</a>] Because it is always difficult to prove derivation for access to Confidential Information, when disclosing its information (Form G3) ABC does not include an exception for internal development, whereas in Form G4 such an exception is included.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-10-backlink" id="footnote-3513-10" name="footnote-3513-10">10</a>] As a recipient, ABC has greater rights to disclose to consultants and Related Companies, whereas in Form G3, as the discloser, the Confidant is limited to its own use.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-11-backlink" id="footnote-3513-11" name="footnote-3513-11">11</a>] ABC has greater rights with respect to returning Confidential Information when it is recipient.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3513-13-backlink" id="footnote-3513-13" name="footnote-3513-13">13</a>] A more balanced agreement providing for two-way communication of confidential information.</p>
