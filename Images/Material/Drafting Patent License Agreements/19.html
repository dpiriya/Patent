<div class="ddw18">Chapter 19: Alternative Dispute Resolution</div>



<p class="h3"><a name="00A"></a>Form 19.00A&mdash;Dispute Resolution Negotiations 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> In the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, either Party may initiate resolution of such controversy by providing to the other Party a brief and concise written statement of the initiating Party&rsquo;s claims, together with relevant facts supporting them, and referring to this Section ___. For a period of sixty (60) days after the date of such statement, or such longer period as the Parties may agree in writing, the Parties will make good faith efforts to settle the dispute. Such efforts must include, without limitation, full presentation of the Parties&rsquo; respective positions before the respective presidents or equivalent officers of their respective companies.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00B"></a>Form 19.00B&mdash;Dispute Resolution Negotiations 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any dispute arising directly under the express terms of this Agreement or the grounds for termination thereof will be resolved as follows. First, within ___ days after either Party identifies the existence of a dispute, senior management of both Parties will meet to attempt to resolve such dispute. If the senior management cannot resolve the dispute, either Party may make a written demand for formal dispute resolution. Within ___ days after such written demand, the Parties agree to meet for one day with an impartial mediator solely to consider dispute resolution alternatives other than litigation. If an alternative method of dispute resolution is not agreed upon within ___ days after the one-day mediation, either Party may begin litigation proceedings.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 19.00C&mdash;Dispute Resolution Negotiations: Standstill and Confidentiality</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party agrees not to file for or otherwise initiate a litigation or arbitration directed to the dispute being discussed by the Parties under this Section ___ before or during such discussions. Each Party further agrees that it will retain in confidence any information disclosed by the other Party during such discussions (except for information already in the public domain) and will not use such information or the discussions as the basis for in personam jurisdiction in a court or a declaratory judgment action against the disclosing Party.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 19.01A&mdash;Mediation Provision 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any controversy or dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, its interpretation, performance, or termination, but excluding validity or enforceability of Licensed Patents, that the parties are unable to resolve within ninety (90) days after written notice by one party to the other of the existence of such controversy or dispute will be referred to mediation. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the mediation will be conducted in accordance with the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution (CPR) Model Procedure for Mediation of Business Disputes<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-1" id="footnote-1931-1-backlink" name="footnote-1931-1-backlink">[1]</a> in effect on the date of this Agreement by a mediator mutually selected by the parties. Within thirty (30) days after the mediator has been selected as provided above, both parties and their respective attorneys will meet with the mediator for one mediation session of at least four (4) hours, it being agreed that each party representative attending such mediation session will be a corporate officer or member of the board of directors with authority to settle the dispute. If the dispute cannot be settled at such mediation session or at any mutually agreed continuation thereof, either party may give the other and the mediator a written notice declaring the mediation process at an end.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 19.01B&mdash;Mediation Provision 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Except as provided herein, no civil action with respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be commenced until the matter has been submitted to mediation. Either party may commence mediation by providing to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with AAA and with each other in selecting a mediator from a AAA panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct, and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation are confidential, privileged, and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or nondiscoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may seek equitable relief prior to the mediation to preserve the status quo pending the completion of that process. Except for such an action to obtain equitable relief, neither party may commence a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 45 days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first. Mediation may continue after the commencement of a civil action if the parties so desire. The provisions of this Clause may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs, fees, and expenses, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="01C"></a>Form 19.01C&mdash;Mediation Provision 3</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any dispute, controversy or claim arising under, out of or relating to this contract and any subsequent amendments of this contract, including, without limitation, its formation, validity, binding effect, interpretation, performance, breach or termination, as well as non-contractual claims, shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with the WIPO Mediation Rules. The place of mediation shall be [specify place]. The language to be used in the mediation shall be [specify language].<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-2" id="footnote-1931-2-backlink" name="footnote-1931-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 19.02A&mdash;Arbitration Provision 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, will be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted before a panel of three arbitrators appointed by the AAA. All proceedings will be in English in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Judgment on the award of the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, and the parties agree to personal jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois solely for entry of such judgment.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 19.02B&mdash;Arbitration Provision 2</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any question of infringement of any of the Licensed Patents will be settled by arbitration before a single arbitrator in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02C"></a>Form 19.02C&mdash;Arbitration Provision 3</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. Any controversy or dispute arising out of or in connection with interpretation, performance, breach, or termination of this Agreement, but excluding validity or enforceability of Licensed Patents, that the parties are unable to resolve within ninety (90) days after written notice by one party to the other of the existence of such controversy or dispute, will be submitted to arbitration. The dispute or controversy will be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce, as modified in this Article. Such arbitration will take place in English in Chicago, Illinois, before a single neutral arbitrator selected by the parties from an appropriate list maintained by the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of Illinois and the United States and will render a written decision with the reasons therefor within one (1) year from the date the matter is submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. The institution of any arbitration hereunder will not (a) relieve Licensee of its obligations to make payments to Licensor required by the terms of this Agreement during the continuance of the arbitration proceeding, or (b) prevent Licensor from applying for and obtaining from a court a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunctive relief pending the outcome of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. The decision of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on the parties, and they will comply with such decision in good faith. Each party hereby submits itself to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Illinois, but only for the entry of judgment with respect to the decision of the arbitrator hereunder, including injunctive relief if appropriate to render effective the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, judgment on the award by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of the State of Illinois or any court having jurisdiction. If judicial enforcement or review of the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision is sought, the prevailing party will be entitled to its costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees in addition to any amount of recovery ordered by the court.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02D"></a>Form 19.02D&mdash;Adopted Arbitration Rules</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any dispute arising during the Term of this Agreement that relates to a Party&rsquo;s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement will be resolved by this Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) provision. To invoke this provision, a Party first must send written notice of the dispute to the other Party.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The Parties must attempt resolution by good faith negotiations between their respective presidents (or their equivalents) of the affected subsidiaries, divisions, or business units within 30 days after such notice is received. All negotiations pursuant to this clause will be confidential subject to Article ___ hereof and will be treated by the Parties as compromise and settlement negotiations as if subject to Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If the dispute has not been resolved within 30 days after the notice of dispute, or if the Parties fail to meet within such 30-day period, either Party may initiate an ADR proceeding as provided herein. The Parties will have the right to be represented by counsel in such a proceeding.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. To begin an ADR proceeding, a Party will provide written notice to the other Party of the issues to be resolved by ADR. Within 30 days after its receipt of such notice, the other Party may, by written notice to the Party initiating the ADR, add other issues to be resolved within the same ADR.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. Within 45 days following receipt of the original ADR notice, the Parties will select a mutually acceptable neutral to preside in the resolution of any disputes in this ADR proceeding. If the Parties are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable neutral within such period, either Party may request the President of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution (CPR), 366 Madison Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10017, to select a neutral pursuant to the following procedures:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) The CPR will submit to the Parties a list of not fewer than five (5) candidates within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the request, along with the background and experience of each candidate. No candidate will be an employee, director, or shareholder of either Party or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) Such list will include a statement of disclosure by each candidate of any circumstances likely to affect his or her impartiality.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(c) Each Party will number the candidates in order of preference (with the number one (1) signifying the greatest preference) and will deliver the list to the CPR within 10 days following receipt of the list of candidates. If a Party believes a conflict of interest exists regarding any of the candidates, that Party will provide a written explanation of the conflict to the CPR along with its list showing its order of preference for the candidates. Any Party failing to return a list of preferences on time will be deemed to have no order of preference.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(d) If the Parties collectively have identified fewer than three (3) candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR immediately will designate as the neutral the candidate for whom the Parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference. If a tie should result between two candidates, the CPR may designate either candidate. If the Parties collectively have identified three (3) or more candidates deemed to have conflicts, the CPR will review the explanations regarding conflicts and, in its sole discretion, may either (i) immediately designate as the neutral the candidate for whom the Parties collectively have indicated the greatest preference, or (ii) issue a new list of not less than five (5) candidates, in which case the procedures set forth in subparagraphs 2(a)&ndash;2(d) will be repeated.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">3. No earlier than 30 days or later than 60 days after selection, the neutral will hold a hearing to resolve each of the issues identified by the Parties. The ADR proceeding will take place at a location agreed upon by the Parties. If the Parties cannot agree, the neutral will designate a location other than the principal place of business of either Party or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">4. At least 10 days prior to the hearing, each Party will submit the following to the other Party and the neutral:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) a copy of all exhibits on which such Party intends to rely in any oral or written presentation to the neutral;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) a list of any witnesses such Party intends to call at the hearing, and a short summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(c) a proposed ruling on each issue to be resolved, together with a request for a specific damage award or other remedy for each issue. The proposed rulings and remedies will not contain any recitation of the facts or any legal arguments, will not include consequential or punitive damage awards, and will not exceed one (1) page per issue;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(d) a brief in support of such Party&rsquo;s proposed rulings and remedies, provided that the brief will not exceed twenty (20) pages. This page limitation will apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">5. No discovery will be required or permitted by any means, including depositions, interrogatories, requests for admissions, or production of documents.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">6. The hearing will be conducted on two (2) consecutive days and will be governed by the following rules:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(a) Each Party will be entitled to five (5) hours of hearing time to present its case. The neutral will determine whether each Party has had the five (5) hours to which it is entitled.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(b) Each Party will be entitled, but not required, to make an opening statement, to present regular and rebuttal testimony, documents or other evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, and to make a closing argument. Cross-examination of witnesses will occur immediately after their direct testimony, and cross-examination time will be charged against the Party conducting the cross-examination.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(c) The Party initiating the ADR will begin the hearing and, if it chooses to make an opening statement, will address not only issues it raised but also any issues raised by the responding Party. The responding Party, if it chooses to make an opening statement, also will address all issues raised in the ADR. Thereafter, the presentation of regular and rebuttal testimony and documents, other evidence, and closing arguments will proceed in the same sequence.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(d) Except when testifying, witnesses will be excluded from the hearing until closing arguments.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">(e) Settlement negotiations, including any statements made therein, will not be admissible under any circumstances. Affidavits prepared for purposes of the ADR hearing also will not be admissible. As to all other matters, the neutral will have sole discretion regarding the admissibility of any evidence.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">7. Within 10 days following completion of the hearing, each Party may submit to the other Party and the neutral a post-hearing brief in support of its proposed rulings and remedies, provided that such brief will not contain or discuss any new evidence and will not exceed ten (10) pages. This page limitation shall apply regardless of the number of issues raised in the ADR proceeding. No reply briefs will be permitted.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">8. The neutral will rule on each disputed issue within 30 days following completion of the hearing. Such ruling will adopt in its entirety the proposed ruling and remedy of one of the Parties on each disputed issue but may adopt one Party&rsquo;s proposed rulings and remedies on some issues and the other Party&rsquo;s proposed rulings and remedies on other issues. The neutral will not issue any written opinion or otherwise explain the basis of the ruling.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">9. The neutral will be paid a reasonable fee plus expenses. The neutral will allocate these fees and expenses and all attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in a way that bears a reasonable relationship to the outcome of the ADR, with the Party prevailing on more issues, or on issues of greater value or gravity, recovering a relatively larger share of its legal fees and expenses.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">10. The rulings of the neutral and the allocation of fees and expenses shall be binding, nonreviewable, and nonappealable, and may be entered as a final judgment in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02E"></a>Form 19.02E&mdash;Arbitration Confidentiality</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The Parties will hold in confidence the nature and substance of any dispute between the Parties, the fact that an arbitration has been initiated, all information disclosed by either Party and all evidence elicited during such arbitration proceedings, and the award rendered in such arbitration. All such information will be Confidential Information subject to the obligations and exceptions of Article ___ of this Agreement.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-3" id="footnote-1931-3-backlink" name="footnote-1931-3-backlink">[3]</a> The arbitrator will have authority to enforce confidentiality obligations.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03A"></a>Form 19.03A&mdash;Staged ADR Provision 1</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, either Party may initiate resolution of such controversy by providing to the other Party written notice of the initiating Party&rsquo;s claims. Within thirty (30) days thereafter, or such longer period as the Parties may agree in writing, representatives of the Parties, who must be division managers or equivalent with the power to settle the dispute, will meet in person and in good faith attempt to settle the dispute.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after the notice of dispute, either Party, by written notice to the other Party, may seek mediation. The mediation will be conducted in accordance with the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution (CPR) Model Procedure for Mediation of Business Disputes in effect on the date of this Agreement by a mediator selected by the Parties from a list supplied by CPR. If the Parties cannot agree on a mediator within ten (10) business days after receipt of the list from CPR, then CPR will appoint a mediator. Within thirty (30) days after the mediator has been selected or appointed as provided above, both Parties and their respective attorneys will meet with the mediator, it being agreed that each party representative attending such mediation session will be a corporate officer or member of the board of directors with authority to settle the dispute. Mediation sessions will continue so long as the Parties and the mediator believe progress is being made. If either Party or the mediator comes to believe further mediation would be futile, mediation will terminate.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Either Party may initiate arbitration within thirty (30) days after termination of mediation. The Parties hereby agree to arbitrate any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. Such dispute will be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA. All proceedings will be in English in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Judgment on the award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, and the Parties agree to personal jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois solely for entry of such judgment.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="03B"></a>Form 19.03B&mdash;Staged ADR Provision 2</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for mediation, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding arbitration pursuant to the clause set forth in Paragraph 5 below.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from the JAMS panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith and that they will share equally in its costs.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">4. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">5. Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial mediation session or at any time following 45 days from the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first (&ldquo;Earliest Initiation Date&rdquo;). The mediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration if the parties so desire.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">6. At no time prior to the Earliest Initiation Date shall either side initiate an arbitration or litigation related to this Agreement except to pursue a provisional remedy that is authorized by law or by JAMS Rules or by agreement of the parties. However, this limitation is inapplicable to a party if the other party refuses to comply with the requirements of Paragraph 3 above.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">7. All applicable statutes of limitation and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled until 15 days after the Earliest Initiation Date. The parties will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1931-4" id="footnote-1931-4-backlink" name="footnote-1931-4-backlink">[4]</a></p>
