<p class="h3"><a name="03"></a>Form 32.03&mdash;Agreement Terms for Multipatent Licensing</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Article I</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Background</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.01 Licensor represents that it is the owner of the patents enumerated in Schedule A, attached to this Agreement, and is willing to grant nonexclusive licenses to Licensee under any or all of such patents.</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.02 Licensee has indicated its wish to acquire licenses under items 1, 2, 5, and 6 of Schedule A, such items being hereafter referred to as Licensed Patents.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Article II</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Grant by Licensor</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.01 . . . .</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.02 . . . .</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.03 Notwithstanding the grants of paragraphs 2.01 and 2.02 of this Article II, no license is granted or implied by this Agreement under any patent of Licensor other than the Licensed Patents, whether or not the claims of such other patent dominate the claimed invention of any Licensed Patent.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-2113-1" id="footnote-2113-1-backlink" name="footnote-2113-1-backlink">[1]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Article III</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Royalties</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.01 Licensee agrees to pay to Licensor a royalty in an amount equal to the &ldquo;applicable percentage,&rdquo; as defined in paragraph 3.03 of this Article III, of the Net Selling Price (as defined in paragraph 4.03 of this Agreement) of all Contract Products that are sold or otherwise disposed of under the license herein granted.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.02 Licensee also agrees to pay to Licensor the Applicable Minimum Annual Royalty, as defined in paragraph 3.04 of this Article III.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.03 The Applicable Percentage of the net selling price of each Contract Product is to be determined from the attached Schedule A by first selecting the relevant group of applicable patents (i.e., the group of unexpired Licensed Patents each of which has one or more claims applicable to such Contract Product or its manufacture), next selecting from the applicable patents the single patent with an individual royalty rate that is the highest individual royalty rate of the applicable patents, and then adding to this highest individual royalty rate the incremental royalty rate of each of the remaining applicable patents. The sum resulting from this addition of rates is the Applicable Percentage.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.04 The Applicable Minimum Annual Royalty is to be determined from the attached Schedule B by first identifying all applicable patents (as selected in paragraph 3.03 of this Article III) applicable to any Contract Products or their manufacturer, next selecting from these applicable patents the single patent with an individual minimum annual royalty that is the highest individual minimum annual royalty of the applicable patents, and then adding to this highest minimum individual annual royalty the incremental minimum annual royalty of each of the remaining applicable patents. The sum resulting from this addition of minimum annual royalties is the Applicable Minimum Annual Royalty.</p>
<p class="ddw12">3.05 The obligation to pay royalties will terminate as to each of the Licensed Patents upon its expiration, except that royalties accrued but not paid prior to such expiration must be paid with the next report submitted by Licensee under the provisions of Article IV hereof. Upon expiration of a Licensed Patent both the Applicable Percentage and the Applicable Minimum Annual Royalty payable under the remaining Licensed Patents shall be re-determined in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs 3.03 and 3.04 of this Article III. Where two or more Applicable Minimum Annual Royalties are in effect during successive periods of any calendar year because of the expiration during that year of one or more Licensed Patents, each of such Applicable Minimum Annual Royalties will be prorated to cover only the period during which such Applicable Minimum Annual Royalty was in effect.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Article IV</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Reports and Payments</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.01 Licensee will make written reports to Licensor semiannually within sixty (60) days after the first days of January and July of each year during the term of this Agreement and as of such dates stating in each such report the Net Selling Price of all Contract Products sold or otherwise disposed of under each group of applicable Licensed Patents (as selected in paragraph 3.03 of Article III hereof) during the preceding six (6) months, together with a listing of the patents in each such group.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.02 Simultaneously with each report provided for in paragraph 4.01 of this Article IV, Licensee will pay to Licensor the royalties shown by such report to be due and payable.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.03 (Includes conventional definition of Net Selling Price)</p>
<p class="ddw12">. . . .</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Article VII</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Termination</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.01 . . . .</p>
<p class="ddw12">7.02 At any time after three (3) years from the effective date of this Agreement, Licensee will have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety or its license under any, some, or all of the Licensed Patents at the end of any calendar year, provided there is no default hereunder, by written notice given to Licensor at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of such year.</p>

<p class="ddw12noindent">Background</p>
<p class="ddw12">1.00 ABC Company is the owner of U.S. Patent No. 5,180,294 that claims an irradiating apparatus using as a key element a specialized electronic tube known in the relevant trade as a &ldquo;GAMMATRON.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ddw12">2.00 Patented Equipment means irradiating apparatus that is covered by one or more of the claims of Patent No. 5,180,294 and that, except for the license granted herein, would constitute infringement of one or more of the claims.
