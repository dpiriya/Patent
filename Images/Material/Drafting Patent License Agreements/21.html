<div class="ddw18">Chapter 21: Term and Termination of the Agreement</div>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 21.01A&mdash;Term and Termination</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. The word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; and cognate words, such as &ldquo;term&rdquo; and &ldquo;terminate,&rdquo; used in this Article ___ and elsewhere in this Agreement are to be read, except where the contrary is specifically indicated, as omitting from their effect the following rights and obligations, all of which survive any termination to the degree necessary to permit their complete fulfillment or discharge:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Licensee&rsquo;s obligation to supply a terminal report as specified in Section ___ of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Licensor&rsquo;s right to receive or recover and Licensee&rsquo;s obligation to pay royalties (including minimum royalties) accrued or accruable for payment at the time of any termination.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. Licensee&rsquo;s obligation to maintain records and Licensor&rsquo;s right to conduct a final audit as provided in Section ___ of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">d. Licensee&rsquo;s obligation to hold in confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to Licensee by Licensor as provided in Section ___ of this Agreement.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-2407-1" id="footnote-2407-1-backlink" name="footnote-2407-1-backlink">[1]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">e. Licenses, releases, and agreements of nonassertion running in favor of customers or transferees of Licensee in respect to products that were sold or transferred by Licensee prior to any termination and on which royalties have been paid as provided in Section ___ of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">f. Sublicenses granted by Licensee prior to the time of termination will continue in effect provided the sublicensee agrees in writing thereafter to render performance to Licensor.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">g. Any cause of action or claim of Licensor accrued or to accrue because of any breach or default of Licensee.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. If Licensee at any time defaults in the payment of any royalty or the making of any report hereunder, or commits any breach of any covenant herein contained, or makes any false report and fails to remedy any such default, breach, or report within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof by Licensor, Licensor may, at its option, terminate this agreement and the license herein granted by notice in writing to such effect.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. Unless previously terminated in accordance with other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder to Licensee will run until expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents and will thereupon terminate.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 21.01B&mdash;Term and Termination (Alternative)</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">1. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, this Agreement and the licenses granted herein will continue in effect from the Effective Date until expiration of the last to expire of the Licensed Patents.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">2. If Licensee at any time fails to make timely payment of any royalty or rendering of any required report, makes any false report, or commits any other material breach of any obligation under this Agreement, and if Licensee fails to remedy any such breach within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof by Licensor, Licensor may, at its option, terminate this agreement and the licenses granted herein by notice in writing to such effect.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">3. Termination of this Agreement under Section 1 or Section 2 will have the following effects:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">a. Except for the post-termination rights to dispose of Licensed Products on hand as provided in subsection b below, the license granted in Sections ___ and ___ will end, and Licensee will have no further right or license under the Licensed Patents or Licensed Technology.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">b. Licensee may sell or otherwise dispose of all Licensed Products on hand as of the date of termination, provided Licensee pays royalties on such sales or other dispositions in accordance with Article ___ hereof and completes such sale or other disposition within ninety (90) days after the date of termination.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">c. Licensee will discontinue manufacture of all Licensed Products and use of all Licensed Technology as of the date of termination.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">d. Within ninety (90) days after the date of termination, Licensee will destroy all embodiments of Licensed Technology and will certify to Licensor completion of such destruction in a writing signed by an officer of Licensee.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">e. Within sixty (60) days after the date of termination, Licensee will render a final report and pay all accrued royalties as required in Sections ___ and ___ hereof on all Licensed Products sold by or for Licensee prior to the date of termination for which no report had been rendered or royalties paid.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">f. Licensor will retain the right to conduct a post-termination audit in accordance with Section ___ hereof and Licensee will retain books and records as required by Section ___ hereof until after such audit and any subsequent dispute arising from such audit.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">g. In addition to the foregoing, each Party reserves for itself all other remedies available at law or in equity, except those remedies expressly disclaimed in this Agreement.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-2407-2" id="footnote-2407-2-backlink" name="footnote-2407-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 21.02A&mdash;Termination for Breach</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">A Party at any time may provide written notice to the other Party of a material breach of the Agreement. If the other Party fails to cure the identified breach within ninety (90) days after the date of the notice, the aggrieved Party may terminate the Agreement by written notice to the Party in breach.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 21.02B&mdash;Specifying Material Breach</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The Parties agree that timely payment of royalties by Licensee is of the essence of the Agreement and failure to make any royalty payment on time will be a material breach.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02C"></a>Form 21.02C&mdash;Automatic Termination for Uncured Breach</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">A Party at any time may provide written notice to the other Party of termination of this Agreement for a material breach thereof. Such termination will be effective ninety (90) days after the date of the notice unless before the end of that period the other Party cures the breach identified in the notice. If the breach is cured in the specified period, the notice of termination will be void and of no effect.</p>



<p class="h3"><a name="03"></a>Form 21.03&mdash;Termination on Change of Control</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor will have the right to terminate the Agreement upon written notice to Licensee should the Licensee undergo a Change in Control. For purposes of this provision, a &ldquo;Change in Control&rdquo; shall mean (a) a consolidation or merger of a Party with or into any other entity or person, or any other corporate reorganization, in which the capital stock of such Party immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, or reorganization represents less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving entity (or, if the surviving entity is a wholly owned subsidiary, its parent) immediately after such consolidation, merger, or reorganization; or (b) any transaction or series of related transactions in which more than fifty percent (50%) of a Party&rsquo;s voting power is transferred to a single entity or person (or affiliates thereof) (excluding transfers of Company stock to an underwriter in connection with a public offering); or (c) the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a Party in any transaction or series of related transactions (other than a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of such Party to an entity, more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by stockholders of such Party in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of such Party immediately prior to such sale).</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="04"></a>Form 21.04&mdash;Termination for Uncured Breach Not the Sole Remedy</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The right of either Party to terminate under the provisions of this Article ___ will not be an exclusive remedy, and either Party, except as expressly disclaimed in this Agreement, will be entitled, if the circumstances warrant, alternatively or cumulatively, to damages for breach of this Agreement, to an order requiring performance of obligations of this Agreement, or to any other remedy available at law or equity.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2407-1-backlink" id="footnote-2407-1" name="footnote-2407-1">1</a>] This assumes the section directed to Confidential Information includes provisions that exclude information that becomes unworthy of protection due to public disclosure or that defines a period after which obligations expire.
	
    
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2407-2-backlink" id="footnote-2407-2" name="footnote-2407-2">2</a>] The exception is intended to avoid the inadvertent inconsistency that could arise between a reservation of remedies and express disclaimers of, for example, consequential damages.
