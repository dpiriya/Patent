<p class="h3"><a name="03"></a>Form 3.03&mdash;Examples of Allocation of Rights to Sue for Infringement in an Exclusive License</p>
<p class="h4"><a name="03A"></a>Form 3.03A</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">While and as long as its license under this Agreement remains exclusive, Licensee is empowered&mdash;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (a) To bring suit in its own name, or if required by law, jointly with Licensor, at its own expense and on its own behalf, for infringement of the Licensed Patents;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (b) In any such suit, to enjoin infringement and to collect for its use, damages, profits, and awards of whatever nature recoverable for such infringement; and</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (c) To settle any claim or suit for infringement of the Licensed Patents by granting the infringing party a sublicense under the provisions of Article ____ of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In the event Licensor brings to the attention of Licensee any infringement of the Licensed Patents, and Licensee does not, within six months,</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (a) Secure cessation of the infringement,</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (b) Enter suit against the infringer, or</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (c) Provide Licensor with evidence of the pendency of a bona fide negotiation for the acceptance by the infringer of a sublicense under the Licensed Patents,</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">the license herein granted to Licensee will forthwith become nonexclusive, and Licensor will thereafter have the right to sue for the infringement at Licensor&rsquo;s own expense, and to collect for its own use all damages, profits, and awards of whatever nature recoverable for such infringement.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1846-1" id="footnote-1846-1-backlink" name="footnote-1846-1-backlink">[1]</a></p>
<p class="h4"><a name="03B"></a>Form 3.03B</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">While and as long as its license under this agreement remains exclusive, Licensee is empowered&mdash;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (a) To bring suit in its own name, or if required by law, jointly with Licensor, for infringement of the Licensed Patents;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (b) In any such suit, to enjoin infringement and to collect for its own use, damages, profits, and awards of whatever nature recoverable for such infringement; and</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> (c) To settle any claim or suit for infringement of the Licensed Patents by granting the infringing party a sublicense under the provisions of Article ____ of this Agreement, provided, however, that any such settlement will be subject to prior approval by Licensor if it adversely affects any right of or imposes any obligation on Licensor.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">In any such suit brought by Licensee, Licensor will reimburse Licensee for one-half of the attorneys&rsquo; fees and necessary out-of-pocket costs incurred by Licensee, provided, however, Licensor&rsquo;s obligation for such reimbursement will not exceed one-half the total royalties received by Licensor from Licensee as of the date on which such suit was filed, and provided further that Licensor will be liable for reimbursement in respect to one suit only.</p>
<p class="h4"><a name="03C"></a>Form 3.03C</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensor in its own name, or jointly with Licensee if required by law, will bring and will diligently prosecute such suits for infringement of the Licensed Patents as may be reasonably necessary to prevent unlicensed infringers from materially injuring the business of Licensee under the Licensed Patents, but Licensor will not be obligated to bring more than one such suit at a time.</p>
<p class="h4"><a name="03D"></a>Form 3.03D</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee, as exclusive licensee, has the power to institute and prosecute at its own expense suits for infringement of the Licensed Patents, and if required by law, Licensor will join as party plaintiff in such suits. All expenses in such suits will be borne entirely by Licensee, and Licensee will pay to Licensor twenty-five percent (25%) of any excess of recoveries over expenses in such suits.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-1846-2" id="footnote-1846-2-backlink" name="footnote-1846-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>
<p class="h4"><a name="03E"></a>Form 3.03E</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee, upon prompt consultation and notification to Licensor and at Licensee&rsquo;s sole expense, will have the right to enforce Licensed Patent Rights against infringement in the Territory and the Field of Use or otherwise to abate such infringement, to take (or refrain from taking) appropriate action to enforce Licensed Patent Rights, to control any litigation or other enforcement action, and to enter into, or permit, the settlement of any such litigation or other enforcement action with respect to Licensed Patent Rights. Such right includes the right to recover any damages awarded for or amounts paid in settlement of any actual or alleged infringement of the Licensed Patent Rights. Licensor, at Licensee&rsquo;s expense, will join any litigation or other enforcement action to the extent required by a court in order for Licensee to exercise the rights granted by this Section.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1846-1-backlink" id="footnote-1846-1" name="footnote-1846-1">1</a>] The licensor&rsquo;s contingent right to sue as provided in this provision could deprive the licensee of &ldquo;all substantial rights.&rdquo; See Abbott Laboratories v. Diamedix Corp., 47 F.3d 1128, 33 USPQ2d 1771 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-1846-2-backlink" id="footnote-1846-2" name="footnote-1846-2">2</a>] The usefulness in some contexts of an &ldquo;excess of recoveries over expenses&rdquo; provision is illustrated by Contour Chair-Lounge Co. v. Laskowitz, 330 S.W.2d 817, 124 USPQ 52 (Mo. 1959). The exclusive licensee, Contour, had agreed to pay (1) royalties of $1.50 per chair and (2) all reasonable and necessary expenses of litigation. Contour sued an infringer, expending $30,000 in the action. It obtained a judgment for $14,000, which it settled for $13,000. In follow-up litigation between Contour and its licensor, the licensor recovered $5,239.50, a sum corresponding to $1.50 for each infringing chair involved in the prior suits.</p>
