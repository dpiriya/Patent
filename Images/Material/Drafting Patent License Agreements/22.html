<p class="ddw12noindent">John P.

The said John P. Jones hereby acknowledges that Licensor has the right and license to grant the rights, releases, and sublicenses granted to Licensee in the Agreement, and to the extent that any of his rights are or may be affected, agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the said Agreement, and further agrees that he will look to Licensor, and not to Licensee, for any and all royalty payments and other remunerations, if any, that are due or that might become due him by virtue of the licenses, rights, and releases granted to Licensee under the Agreement. He further agrees that if the exclusive license that he has granted to Licensor and that is now in effect and under the authority of which the present Agreement has been entered into between Licensor and Licensee is canceled or terminated for whatever reason prior to the end of term of the present Agreement, the rights, licenses, and releases granted under the present Agreement will continue in full force and effect, the same as if he, John P. Jones, had been the original Licensor, provided the Licensee agrees in writing to thereafter render to John P. Jones all obligations that the present Agreement then requires Licensee to render to Licensor. He further agrees that the terms, conditions, and obligations of this Assent will be binding on himself, his heirs, assigns, and legal representatives.</p>
