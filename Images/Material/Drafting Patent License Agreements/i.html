<p class="ddw12hang3">b. &ldquo;Confidential and Proprietary Information&rdquo; means information disclosed to, learned, or known by the Employee as a consequence of or through his or her engagement by the Company, about the Company&rsquo;s plans, products, processes, or services, including, without limitation, information relating to organisms, parts of organisms, compounds, testing apparatus, devices, prototypes and models, and any other information relating to research, development, inventions, manufacture, purchasing, accounting, engineering, marketing, merchandising, and selling.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">c. &ldquo;Inventions&rdquo; means inventions, discoveries, concepts, and ideas, whether patentable or not, including but not limited to processes, methods, formulae, software, techniques, strains and cultures, cell parts, and organisms, as well as improvements thereof or know-how related thereto, concerning any present or prospective activities of the Company with which the Employee becomes acquainted as a result of his or her engagement by the Company.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">d. &ldquo;Competing Organization&rdquo; means any person or organization engaged in or about to become engaged in research on, or development, production, marketing, or selling of, a Competing Product.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3">e. &ldquo;Competing Product&rdquo; means any product, process, or service of any person or organization other than the Company, in existence or under development, that competes, directly or indirectly, with a product, process, or service on or with which the Employee has worked for the Company or about which the Employee acquires Confidential and Proprietary Information.</p>

<p class="ddw12hang2">2. <strong>Duties</strong>. In consideration for his or her engagement and continuing engagement by the Company, the Employee will faithfully and to the best of his or her ability perform and render such services and perform such duties for the Company as it may reasonably request, or as may be necessary or desirable in performing or carrying out the intention of this engagement.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">3. <strong>Compensation and Term</strong>. As compensation for his or her services, the Employee will receive $_________ per annum payable in ____________ installments commencing on ____________, subject to periodic revision mutually agreed on by the Employee and the Company.

The Company may terminate such engagement for cause at any time, and without prior notice if the Employee (1) defaults in or fails to perform any of the provisions of this Agreement for whatever reason, including death, disability, or incapacity; (2) engages in conduct materially injurious to the Company; or (3) is charged with or convicted of any felony or a misdemeanor involving fraud, breach of trust, misappropriation, or other similar activity, in each case based on the Company&rsquo;s determination in its reasonable discretion that such cause for termination exists. If Employee&rsquo;s engagement is terminated without cause, the Company will pay the Employee the lesser of _______ months&rsquo; compensation or the compensation otherwise due during the unexpired term of this Agreement (excluding future extensions). Such payments will be made at the time or times they would have been made had this engagement not been terminated.
