<p class="h3"><a name="00C"></a>Form 25.00C&mdash;Limitation on Geographic Scope of Release or License</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Nothing in this Agreement should be construed as granting to either of the parties rights under any patents of any foreign country, or as limiting the right of either party to assert in foreign countries against the other party or those in privity with it claims based on patents of those countries. Conversely, nothing in this Agreement limits or bars assertion of any defense available to either party in respect to any claim of patent infringement asserted against it or those in privity with it by the other party in any foreign country.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="00D"></a>Form 25.00D&mdash;Release of Claims Based on Confidential Information</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">ABC, for itself, its successors, and its assigns, releases and forever discharges XYZ, its past and present directors, officers, employees, successors, assigns, customers, and other transferees from all promises, causes of action, claims, and demands whatsoever in law or in equity that, as against XYZ, its past or present directors, officers, employees, successors, customers, or other transferees, ABC, severally or jointly with others, ever has had, now has, or may at any time have or claim to have and that arise or are claimed to arise out of any unauthorized disclosure or use by XYZ prior to the date of this Agreement, of any information of any kind, allegedly confidential or otherwise, and relating to the field, art, technology, design, development, manufacture, lease, sale, or business of spring valves.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="00E"></a>Form 25.00E&mdash;Release Conditioned on Compliance With Other Terms</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The releases and covenants not to sue set forth in this Agreement are conditioned on compliance by XYZ with all the provisions of Article ___ of this Agreement and will be effective only upon such compliance and upon entry of an order of dismissal of Civil Action No. ____________, as provided in Article ___ of this Agreement.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01A"></a>Form 25.01A&mdash;Stipulation of Dismissal With Prejudice</p>

<p class="ddw12noindent">________________________________<br>
Attorneys for Plaintiff</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">________________________________<br>
Attorneys for Defendant</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="01B"></a>Form 25.01B&mdash;Dismissal of Suit Deferred</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Unless prior to January 1, 20 __, ABC has asserted a breach by XYZ of its commitments under Article ___ of this Agreement, then, on that date, the attached stipulation of dismissal of suit will become effective and may then or thereafter be entered by either party without notice to the other party.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="02A"></a>Form 25.02A&mdash;Limitation on Publicizing Settlement</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">No public statement respecting the terms or circumstances of the settlement represented by this Agreement will be made by either party except in the following form:</p>
<p class="ddw12block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ABC Company and XYZ Company have announced that their litigation respecting patents on ______________________________ has been settled on a mutually acceptable basis. The suit pending between them in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York is being dismissed.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Neither party will authorize, nor, so far as within its power, permit, publicity concerning the settlement except as provided in this Article ___.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02B"></a>Form 25.02B&mdash;Exceptions to Confidentiality</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each Party agrees that other than the public announcement referenced in Section ___ above, each Party will treat both the existence of this Agreement and the specific terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all financial terms) as confidential and neither Party will disclose the existence of this Agreement or such terms or conditions to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that each Party may disclose the terms and conditions of this Agreement only:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(a) as required by any court or other governmental body;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(b) as otherwise required by law;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(c) as otherwise may be required by applicable securities and other law and regulation, including the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(d) to legal counsel, accountants, and other licensed financial advisors of the Parties, subject to obligations of confidentiality;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(e) in confidence, to the outside counsel of banks, investors and other financing sources, subject to a non-disclosure agreement containing terms respecting confidentiality customary to the corresponding potential transaction;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(f) to the extent necessary for the enforcement of this Agreement or rights under this Agreement;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(g) during the course of litigation so long as (i) all financial terms are redacted, subject to subsection (a) above, (ii) the disclosure of all unredacted terms and conditions are restricted to outside counsel&rsquo;s eyes only, (iii) such restrictions are embodied in a court-entered protective order limiting disclosure to outside counsel and restricting such outside counsel from sharing any such terms except as necessary in court filings, hearings, or trial, and then only when done under seal or other appropriate mechanism to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and (iv) the disclosing Party informs the other Party in writing at least ten (10) business days in advance of the disclosure and discusses the nature and contents of the disclosure, in good faith, with the other Party;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(h) in confidence, to a Third Party&rsquo;s outside counsel only, in connection with an actual or prospective merger or acquisition with such Third Party, subject to a non-disclosure agreement containing terms respecting confidentiality customary to such prospective transaction; and</p>
<p class="ddw12hang1">(i) in confidence by Defendant to the outside counsel of their actual customers who have purchased or who have agreed to purchase Licensed Products from Defendant but only to the extent necessary to show such products are licensed, excluding in all cases all financial terms;</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Prior to any such disclosure pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and/or (g) hereof, the Party seeking to make such disclosure shall notify (providing the other Party reasonable advance notice thereof) and, if requested, consult with the other Party and take all reasonable actions in an effort to minimize the nature and extent of such disclosure, including seeking confidential treatment or protective orders to the extent available.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Upon execution of this Agreement, or thereafter, either Party, in its discretion, will be entitled to file a copy of this Agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, so long as such Party seeks confidential treatment of such agreement to the extent reasonably possible and gives the other Party at least twenty-four (24) hours notice prior to the filing.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02C"></a>Form 25.02C&mdash;Requirements Imposed to Ensure Compliance With Limited Publicity</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Promptly upon the entry by the court of an Order of Dismissal of the litigation being settled by this Agreement, each party will distribute to its officers, employees, and sales representatives a notice as follows, the notice to be signed by an officer of the distributing company:</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patent litigation between ABC Company and XYZ Company that has been pending for several years in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in reference to _______________, has been settled upon terms satisfactory to each of the parties.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Neither party desires to attempt to take commercial advantage of the settlement through public or private comment, and you are therefore instructed that no director, officer, employee, sales representative, or other person acting on behalf of this company is to make any statement about the litigation or its settlement that departs from or goes beyond the express terms of the information contained in the first paragraph of this instruction.</p>


<p class="h3"><a name="03"></a>Form 25.03&mdash;Accused Infringer Waives Right to Relitigate Validity and Enforceability</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Defendant will not hereafter challenge or aid others in challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the Asserted Patents. In any subsequent legal proceeding or arbitration proceeding in which plaintiff asserts infringement by defendant of any Asserted Patent, defendant waives the right to contest validity and enforceability of the Asserted Patents.</p>
