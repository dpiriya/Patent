<div class="ddw18">Appendix H: Forms for Dealing With Outside Submissions</div>

<p class="ddw12">The forms set forth in this Appendix supplement information presented in Chapter 27, and particularly Section 27.02, and deal with the issues presented to a business entity in dealing with information of low technical value submitted by outsiders.</p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="H1"></a>Form H1&mdash;Outside Submission Form&mdash;Where Compensation Is Not Expected</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Submitted Ideas Department<br>
XYZ Company<br>
New York, New York</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"> The suggestion concerning ___________________________________________________________<br>
_________________________________________________________________________ which I am submitting for your consideration is submitted gratuitously and without expectation of compensation. You are free to consider and use it without obligation to me for its consideration or use.</p>
<p class="ddw12_335">________________________________________<br>

<p class="h3"><a name="H2"></a>Form H2&mdash;Outside Submission Form&mdash;Where Compensation Is Hoped For</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Acceptance of Conditions</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">XYZ Company:</p>
<p class="ddw12">I have read your booklet on Policies Concerning Submitted Ideas. In consideration of the Company&rsquo;s being willing to examine certain ideas that I have submitted or propose to submit, I agree to the Conditions of Submission set forth below. I further agree that such Conditions shall apply to all disclosures made incidental to the original material submitted and to all information previously or hereafter disclosed or submitted relating directly or indirectly to such material. The subject matter which I am submitting relates to the following:</p>
<p class="ddw12_335">________________________________________<br>
Signature of Submitter<br>
<Br>Date:&nbsp;___________________________________<br>
________________________________________<br>
________________________________________<br>
Submitter's Address</p>

<p class="ddw12noindentcenter"><br>
Conditions of Submission</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. No confidential relationship is established by such submission or implied from consideration of the submitted material, and the material is not submitted &ldquo;in confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">2. The Company makes no commitment to keep secret the idea or material submitted in connection with it.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">3. The Company will not pay any compensation whatsoever for use of ideas that have not been patented. If, despite these Conditions of Submission, the submitter claims that the Company is liable for use of any unpatented idea submitted to it, the submitter waives any right to seek equitable relief or damages in excess of $1,000, which sum the submitter agrees is the maximum damages for any and all liability of the Company with respect to such unpatented idea, including but not limited to the Company&rsquo;s use or disclosure thereof. If any such unpatented idea subsequently is claimed in a patent granted to the submitter, the foregoing clause will not apply to any rights under such patent.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">4. The submitter agrees that reception and consideration by the Company of any submitted idea will not prevent the Company from contesting validity or infringement of any patent that may claim the submitted idea. The submitter&rsquo;s sole remedy if he or she believes the Company to be infringing such patent will be enforcement by the submitter under the applicable patent laws of such exclusive rights as the submitter may possess by virtue of his or her patent.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">5. The Company will give each submitted idea only such consideration as in the judgment of the Company it merits.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">6. The Company will be under no obligation to return any material submitted or to reveal its acts in connection with the submitted idea.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">7. The Company will be under no obligation to reveal any information regarding its activities in either the general or specific field to which the submitted idea pertains.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">8. If the Company decides not to offer compensation for a submitted idea, it assumes no obligation to give reasons for its decision&mdash;or to do other than to communicate its decision to the submitter.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">9. Entering into negotiation for the purchase of any idea submitted, or the making of any offer for its purchase, will not in any way prejudice the Company, nor will it be deemed an admission of the novelty of the idea, or of priority or originality on the part of the person submitting it or of any other person.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">10. Any and all prior negotiations or agreements by any agent or representative of the Company are merged into these Conditions of Submission, and no such prior representations, negotiations, or agreements will be binding on the Company or of any force or effect.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">11. The foregoing Conditions of Submission may not be modified or waived except in writing signed by an officer of the Company, or the General Manager of a Division of the Company, or the Company&rsquo;s General Patent Counsel.</p>
<p class="ddw12">For the most part, the provisions of a form such as the foregoing are clear as to their legal objectives. Several of the numbered items, such as 6, 7, and 8, deal with matters as to which submitters tend to expect more information than the typical company can afford to provide&mdash;particularly if large numbers of submissions are being received.</p>
<p class="ddw12">In respect to item 3, some companies handle the corresponding point by providing that any compensation to be paid will be &ldquo;determined entirely in the discretion of the Company&rdquo; or equivalent wording. There are circumstances, however, in which the protective value of such language may prove illusory because of the disposition of some courts to hold that &ldquo;discretion&rdquo; is limited to the exercise of what the court thinks would represent &ldquo;fairness and good faith&rdquo; in the particular circumstances.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3632-1" id="footnote-3632-1-backlink" name="footnote-3632-1-backlink">[1]</a> The uncertainty of outcome evidenced by these several decisions may well attach to any language whatever that could be used at this point, but the assignment of a specific monetary limit (as in item 3) should make it difficult for an arbitrary award to be made in excess of the stated amount.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3632-2" id="footnote-3632-2-backlink" name="footnote-3632-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>
                
<p class="h3"><a name="H3"></a>Form H3&mdash;Clauses for Use in Acceptance of a Submitted Idea</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">Recitals</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. Submitter represents that he or she is the originator of the ____________________ design shown in drawing no. 17869 attached to this Agreement and bearing the date of ______, ____ that he or she has the right to grant the license included in this Agreement and that he or she has not executed and will not execute any agreement in conflict with such grant.</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">2. Prior to any disclosure of his or her _________________________ design to Company, Submitter received from Company a copy of Company&rsquo;s booklet identified as APC-1-C, and accepted the conditions specified therein by delivering a signed &ldquo;Acceptance of Conditions&rdquo; form to Company on January 2, 2004. After such delivery, Submitter disclosed to Company a _________________________ design corresponding essentially to that shown in drawing no. 17869, above referred to. As a result of its consideration of this disclosure, Company desires to obtain certain rights in respect to the _________________________ design of drawing no. 17896.</p>
<p class="ddw12">Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">I</p>
<p class="ddw12">Submitter grants to Company under any of Submitter&rsquo;s rights of proprietorship, including any patent that may be obtained by Submitter that contains claims applicable to a _________________________ the type shown in drawing no. 17869 or any improved version of such _____________, a license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import such __________________. For a period of five (5) years from the date of this Agreement, Submitter will not grant or agree to grant an equivalent or overlapping license to anyone other than Company, but, at the end of that period, Submitter will be free to grant further licenses if, and only if, Company terminates this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">II</p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">1. For a period of five (5) years from the effective date of this Agreement, Company will pay Submitter as follows in respect to all _________________________ manufactured by or for Company within the period that corresponds to the disclosure of drawing no. 17869:</p>
<p class="ddw12hang3"><em>(Here would be inserted whatever scheme of payment the parties agree upon.)</em></p>
<p class="ddw12hang2">2. Subject to the provisions of Article III of this Agreement and to the further provisions respecting termination that appear in Article X, Company will, for the period following five (5) years from the effective date of this Agreement, make payments to Submitter at the rates specified in paragraph (1) of this Article II in respect to all _________________________ corresponding to or based on the disclosure of drawing no. 17869 that are manufactured by or for Company during the period and that at the time of manufacture are covered by a claim of the U.S. patent granted to Submitter or by a claim allowed to Submitter in an application pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and not (at the time of such manufacture) involved in a contest as to priority of inventorship of the subject matter of such claim.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">III</p>
<p class="ddw12">If, at the end of five (5) years from the effective date of this Agreement, no claim that, in the judgment of Company, is applicable to _________________________ of the type disclosed in drawing no. 17869 has been allowed in any application for patent filed by Submitter in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Company will have the right, exercisable by written notice at any time after the end of the five (5) year period, to terminate this Agreement effective as of the date of notice. Any such termination will terminate all obligations of Company under the Agreement except the obligation for payment (at the rates specified) in respect to_________________________ manufactured by or for Company prior to the date of termination. Termination will be without prejudice to the assertion by Company, in respect to its operations subsequent to termination, of the limitations of liability provided for in Condition 3 of the &ldquo;Acceptance of Conditions&rdquo; form previously referred to in this Agreement.</p>
<p class="ddw12"><em>(Rights of termination by Company under conditions other than those referred to in Article III may in some circumstances be desirable and fair. Such rights would, of course, have to be provided for in subsequent paragraphs of the agreement.)</em></p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">IV, V, VI, ETC.</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent"><em>(Boilerplate provisions covering details of payment and accounting should, of course, be added to the basic provisions already spelled out. Provisions concerning the rights of manufacture in or export to foreign countries may be included if appropriate).</em></p>
<p class="ddw12noindentcenter">* * *</p>
<p class="ddw12">It should be obvious that nothing precludes the waiver by the company of the $1,000 limitation imposed by Condition 3 of the &ldquo;Acceptance of Conditions&rdquo; form on payments to be made to the submitter in the absence of valid patent protection. Whether such a waiver would be equitable depends, of course, on objective evaluation of the worth to the company if the disclosed submission is unpatented. In any such evaluation, one factor to be weighed would be the extent to which any payment above $1,000 would put the company at an economic disadvantage with respect to its competitors, who in the situation postulated would be free to copy the company&rsquo;s product (once marketed) without liability either to the submitter or the company.</p>
