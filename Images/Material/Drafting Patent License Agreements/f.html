<p class="ddw12">2.00 &ldquo;Patent&rdquo; or &ldquo;Patents&rdquo; means the following: U.S. patents and patent applications, patents to be issued pursuant thereto, and all divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part, reissues, substitutes, and extensions thereof:</p>

</table>
<p class="ddw12">2.01 &ldquo;Technical Information&rdquo; means unpublished research and development information, unpatented inventions, know-how, trade secrets, and technical data in the possession of Licensor at the Effective Date of this Agreement that are reasonably necessary to produce Licensed Products and that Licensor has the right to provide to Licensee.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3384-5" id="footnote-3384-5-backlink" name="footnote-3384-5-backlink">[5]</a> A list of documents containing Technical Information to be transferred to Licensee is attached hereto as Appendix ___________.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.02 &ldquo;Licensed Territory&rdquo; means the United States, its territories, and its possessions.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3384-6" id="footnote-3384-6-backlink" name="footnote-3384-6-backlink">[6]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">2.03 &ldquo;Licensed Products&rdquo; means products, the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or import of which, in the absence of this license agreement, would infringe at least one claim of a Patent or products that are made using a process or machine the use of which, in the absence of this license agreement, would infringe a claim of a Patent, or products made, at least in part, using Technical Information.</p>
<p class="ddw12">2.04 &ldquo;Net Sales Price&rdquo;, for the purpose of computing royalties, means Licensee&rsquo;s invoice price, f.o.b. factory, after deduction of regular trade and quantity discounts, but before deduction of any other items, including but not limited to freight allowances, cash discounts, and agents&rsquo; commissions. Where products are not sold, but are otherwise disposed of, the Net Sales Price of such products for the purposes of computing royalties will be the selling price at which products of similar kind and quality, sold in similar quantities, are currently being offered for sale by Licensee. Where such products are not currently being offered for sale by Licensee, the Net Sales Price of products otherwise disposed of, for the purpose of computing royalties, will be the average selling price at which products of similar kind and quality, sold in similar quantities, are then currently being offered for sale by other manufacturers. Where such products are not currently sold or offered for sale by Licensee or others, then the Net Sales Price, for the purposes of computing royalties, will be Licensee&rsquo;s cost of manufacture, determined by Licensee&rsquo;s customary accounting procedures, plus ___________ percent (___________%). In order to assure to the Licensor the full royalty payments contemplated in this Agreement, Licensee agrees that in the event any Licensed Products are sold for purposes of resale either (1) to a corporation, firm, or association that, or individual who, owns a controlling interest in Licensee by stock ownership or otherwise, or (2) to a corporation, firm, or association in which Licensee or its stockholders own a controlling interest by stock ownership or otherwise, the royalties to be paid in respect to such Licensed Products will be computed on the net selling price at which the purchaser for resale sells such Products rather than on the net selling price of the Licensee.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3384-7" id="footnote-3384-7-backlink" name="footnote-3384-7-backlink">[7]</a></p>
<p class="ddw12">2.05 &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo; means ___________, 20__.</p>

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to preclude the export or sale for export of Licensed Products on which royalties are paid as provided in Sections 5.01, 5.02, and 5.03 of this Agreement, subject, however, to the understanding that no rights are granted or implied in respect to such exported products under any patent of Licensor or any other person in any foreign country.</p>

To the extent that any such Technical Information is disclosed to purchasers of Licensee&rsquo;s products or services, Licensee will impose the obligations contained in this Article on all such parties.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.03 Licensee will not use any Technical Information furnished by Licensor other than in the manufacture of Licensed Products and only during the term of this Agreement, provided, however, that other use of such Technical Information may be made (1) with the prior written consent of Licensor, or (2) after it has become public through no fault of Licensee or purchasers of Licensee&rsquo;s products or services.</p>
<p class="ddw12">4.04 Licensor represents that the material lists, drawings, specifications, instructions, and other elements of Technical Information to be supplied by it under this Agreement have been used by it in the manufacture of Licensed Products, but does not otherwise warrant the accuracy of Technical Information; nor does Licensor warrant that Licensed Products produced in accordance with such information will be free from claims of infringement of the patents or copyrights of any third party. Licensor will not, except as provided in this Article IV, be under any liability arising out of the supplying of information under, in connection with, or as a result of this contract, whether on warranty, contract, negligence, or otherwise.</p>

<p class="ddw12">5.02 Licensee will pay to Licensor a continuing royalty of ___________ percent (___________%) of the Net Sales Price of all Licensed Products used, sold, or otherwise disposed pursuant to the license to Technical Information granted under Article IV.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-3384-11" id="footnote-3384-11-backlink" name="footnote-3384-11-backlink">[11]</a></p>

Licensee will notify Licensor of the date of first commercial use or sale promptly thereafter.</p>
<p class="ddw12">10.02 Licensee may terminate this Agreement in part (Article III or Article IV) or in whole at any time upon sixty (60) days&rsquo; written notice in advance to Licensor.

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3384-11-backlink" id="footnote-3384-11" name="footnote-3384-11">11</a>] In a hybrid patent and know-how license, a distinction between consideration for the patent license and the know-how license is important to avoid unenforceability of the agreement in the event the patents expire or are declared invalid. See Meehan v. PPG Indus., 802 F.2d 881, 231 USPQ 400 (7th Cir. 1986); Span-Deck, Inc. v. Fab-Con, Inc., 677 F.2d 1237, 215 USPQ 835 (8th Cir. 1982).</p>

Although licensee may make up the difference between minimum royalties and accrued royalties pursuant to Section 8.00, after a term of years, Section 6.01 requires that royalties accruing from actual sales exceed a certain level.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3384-14-backlink" id="footnote-3384-14" name="footnote-3384-14">14</a>] While a provision clearly denying any right to sublicense avoids any doubt, the right must be specifically granted to be effective.

Note that under Uniform Commercial Code &sect;2-316, disclaimers of certain warranties related to sales of goods must be &ldquo;conspicuous&rdquo; to be effective, which suggests use of all capital letters in such disclaimers. U.C.C. &sect;2-316 (2011). The UCC does not apply to patent licenses, but as a general practice, such disclaimers are capitalized or otherwise rendered conspicuous.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3384-20-backlink" id="footnote-3384-20" name="footnote-3384-20">20</a>] Neither section in Article XII is required in a nonexclusive license, but each provision serves to clarify the parties&rsquo; respective rights.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3384-21-backlink" id="footnote-3384-21" name="footnote-3384-21">21</a>] See &sect;12.05 <em>supra</em>.</p>

If the person is an officer of the corporation, such attestation is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-3384-28-backlink" id="footnote-3384-28" name="footnote-3384-28">28</a>] Because states, in their rules governing conflicts of law, use the location of agreement to determine the law of the agreement, identifying the location may be of consequence if the court refuses to accept the choice of law presented in Section 20 of the agreement.</p>
