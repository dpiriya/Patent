Licensor is free to assert infringement claims based on such other patents against Licensee with respect to Licensee&rsquo;s practice of Licensed Patents and any such assertion will not be considered to be a derogation of Licensee&rsquo;s rights under any of the Licensed Patents.</p>

<p class="ddw12block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The third party] agrees that its purchase of the [Licensed Product] from [Licensee] does not give [the third party] any right or license to use the [Licensed Product] in any product or method claimed in a patent owned by [Licensor]. [The third party] understands that, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no lawful use of the [Licensed Product] without a license under certain patents owned by [Licensor]. [The third party] further understands that upon application [Licensor] will grant a license to [the third party] on standard terms. [The third party] hereby agrees not to use the [Licensed Product] for any purpose without the necessary license. [The third party] may resell the [Licensed Product] in the form acquired from [Licensee] provided [the third party] first obtains from any such purchaser a written agreement signed by such purchaser that includes this provision. [The third party] will promptly deliver to [Licensee] the original of any such written agreement by a purchaser. [The third party] agrees that this contract provision is for the benefit of the [Licensor].</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensee will deliver to Licensor the original of any such agreement obtained by Licensee, directly or indirectly, from any third party.
