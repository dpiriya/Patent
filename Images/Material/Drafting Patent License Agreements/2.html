<p class="h3"><a name="01"></a>Form 2.01&mdash;Definition of Licensed Information</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Licensed Information<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-2130-1" id="footnote-2130-1-backlink" name="footnote-2130-1-backlink">[1]</a> means unpublished research and development information, unpatented inventions, know-how, trade secrets, and technical data in the possession of Licensor at the effective date of this Agreement which are used by Licensor to produce Licensed Products and which Licensor has the right to provide to Licensee. A list of documents containing Licensed Information to be transferred to Licensee is attached hereto as Appendix A.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="02"></a>Form 2.02&mdash;Assignment of Patent and Right to Sue for Past Infringement</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Assignor hereby transfers and assigns to Assignee all right, title, and interest in and to the patents listed in Exhibit A to this Agreement and any other U.S. or foreign patent or patent application that contains the same disclosure as or relies for priority on a patent listed in Exhibit A. Assignor further transfers and assigns to Assignee all causes of action, rights, and remedies arising under any such patent or application prior to or after the effective date of this Agreement.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="03"></a>Form 2.03&mdash;Assignment of Future Inventions</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">The Employee hereby assigns and agrees to assign to the Company all of his or her right, title, and interest in and to all Inventions conceived or reduced to practice during his or her employment and one year thereafter, all applications for U.S. and foreign letters patent disclosing any such Invention, and all U.S. and foreign letters patent granted upon such Inventions.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-2130-2" id="footnote-2130-2-backlink" name="footnote-2130-2-backlink">[2]</a></p>

<p class="h3"><a name="04A"></a>Form 2.04A&mdash;Joint Ownership of Patents</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Any invention jointly made by employees of both parties, and all patent rights therein, will be jointly owned. The parties agree to cooperate in obtaining and maintaining patents on such jointly-owned inventions and to share equally the expenses thereof. In the event of infringement by a third party of a jointly-owned patent, either party may assert such patent and initiate an action for infringement, provided, however, that the other party is given an opportunity in advance to join in the assertion and action and to share equally in the expenses and recoveries. Each party agrees to cooperate and assist the other party in any infringement action brought by the other party in accordance with this provision, including joining the action to the extent necessary to permit the other party to maintain the suit. No party may grant a license under a jointly-owned patent without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.<a class="footnote-link" href="#footnote-2130-3" id="footnote-2130-3-backlink" name="footnote-2130-3-backlink">[3]</a></p>

<p class="h3"><a name="04B"></a>Form 2.04B&mdash;Joint Ownership of Patents&mdash;Sharing</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each party will be free to grant nonexclusive licenses under its interest in any jointly-owned patent provided the other party is given (a) notice of the identity of each such licensee, and (b) fifty percent (50%) of all revenue received pursuant to each such license. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, a party may not grant a license under a jointly-owned patent if such license would deprive the other party of prospective remedies for infringement in an action filed prior to the grant of a license.</p>

<p class="h3"><a name="04C"></a>Form 2.04C&mdash;Worldwide Rights to Exploit Jointly-Owned Patents</p>
<p class="ddw12noindent">Each party that, by virtue of this Agreement, is a joint owner of a Jointly-Owned Patent hereby grants to each other party that is a joint owner of such Jointly-Owned Patent an unrestricted right and license to exploit or to license others to exploit such Jointly-Owned Patent without prior permission of or accounting to the other joint owners.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2130-1-backlink" id="footnote-2130-1" name="footnote-2130-1">1</a>] Defined terms in this book are indicated by initial capital letters. There are other methods for indicating defined terms; the authors believe using initial capital letters is least disruptive when reading an agreement.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2130-2-backlink" id="footnote-2130-2" name="footnote-2130-2">2</a>] The provision assumes that the term &ldquo;Invention&rdquo; is elsewhere defined in terms of its relation to the employer&rsquo;s business. See also the sample employment agreement in Appendix I.</p>
<p class="footnote">[<a class="footnote-anchor" href="#footnote-2130-3-backlink" id="footnote-2130-3" name="footnote-2130-3">3</a>] The phrase &ldquo;which will not be unreasonably withheld&rdquo; often appears in agreement provisions where more definitive terms cannot be negotiated. It imposes on the parties an obligation to act reasonably but leaves open for future dispute what actions would be reasonable. Acceptance of such a &ldquo;negotiated ambiguity&rdquo; is a pragmatic recognition that in negotiation of some provisions there is a point of diminishing returns.</p>
